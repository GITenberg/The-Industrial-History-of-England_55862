<h2 class="h2herein">PREFACE</h2></div>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="spbigcap">T</span>his
little book is an attempt to relate in a short,
concise, and simple form the main outlines of England’s
economic and industrial history. It is meant to
serve as an introduction to a fuller study of the subject
and as a preliminary sketch which the reader can
afterwards, if he wishes, fill in for himself from larger
volumes dealing with special periods. At the same time
it is hoped that this outline may succeed in giving not
only to the student but to the ordinary reader a general
view of a side of history too frequently neglected, but
of the utmost importance to a proper understanding of
the story of the English nation. I have endeavoured,
as far as possible in the brief limits of a work like this, to
connect economic and industrial questions with social,
political, and military movements, believing as I do
that only in some such mutual relation as this can
historical events obtain their full significance.</p>

<p>The paramount necessity of simplicity and conciseness
in an outline of this kind has compelled me to omit or
mention very briefly many points which those who are
familiar with my subject might well expect to be included.
I have not, for instance, given elaborate statistical figures
or voluminous footnotes upon the actual condition of our
trade at various periods. Nor have I given more than an
outline of the old and new Poor Laws, of financial
measures, or of Banking; and with much reluctance I
have omitted a discussion of Colonial Trade. But all
these points, except perhaps the last, may be reserved
by a student till he comes to much larger works; though
a proper economic history of our Colonies yet remains
to be written. Such as it is, however, I trust that this
general view of the broad outlines of the growth of our
wealth and industry in their relation to the general history
of England may have its uses.</p>

<p>I have preferred not to weary my reader by constant
references to authorities in footnotes, but have acknowledged
my obligations to the various authorities consulted
in an appendix, where suggestions for further reading will
be found.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="p-vii" class="h2herein">PREFACE
 TO THE EIGHTEENTH EDITION</h2></div>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="spbigcap">S</span>ince
the original publication of this book in 1890,
twenty-one years have elapsed, and the author, whose
untimely death all scholars deplore, was able to embody
various corrections which made this book harmonize
more completely with his larger work <i>Industry in
England</i>. On certain points he was led to modify his
opinions—a course inevitable in a book covering so large
a ground.</p>

<p>In the Preface to the Fifth Edition he wrote: “It has
been said that I write with a prejudice against the owners
of land: but this is not the case. The landed gentry of
England happen for some centuries to have held the predominant
power in the State and in society, and used it,
not unnaturally, in many cases to further their own
interests. It is the duty of an historian to point this out,
but it need not therefore be thought that he had any
special bias against the class. Any other class would
certainly have done the same, as, for instance, mill-owners
did among their own <i>employées</i> at the beginning
of this century, and as, in all probability, the working
classes will do when a further extension of democratic
government shall have given them the opportunity.</p>

<p>“It is a fault of human nature that it can rarely be trusted
with irresponsible power, and unless the influence of one
class of society is counterbalanced more or less by that
of another, there will always be a tendency to some
injustice. I trust that my readers will bear this in mind
when reading the following pages, and will believe that
I intend no unfairness to the landed gentry of England,
who have done much to promote the glory and
stability of their country.”</p>

<p>The present, or eighteenth edition, has been carefully
revised by Miss M. E. Hirst, M.A., and in addition to such
revision she has written a new chapter (Chapter VIII.)
which treats of the New Age of Industrial Expansion.
<i>The Industrial History of England</i> is thus continued
from the point at which the author left it and is carried
up to the year 1911.</p>

HISTORY OF ENGLAND</div>

<h2 class="h2herein">PERIOD I
<span class="hsmall">
ENGLAND BEFORE THE NORMAN CONQUEST</span></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I
<span class="hsmall">INTRODUCTORY—THE
 ROMANS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS—TRADE</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span></h4>
<span class="smcap">A<b>LTHOUGH</b></span> the industrial history of England does
not properly begin until the settlement made by the Norman
Conquest, it is nevertheless impossible to omit some
reference to the previous economic condition of the country.
As everybody knows, the Romans were the first to
invade Britain, although it had been known, probably
for centuries previously, to the Phenicians and Carthaginians
who used to sail here for its tin and lead. The
Romans, however, first colonized the country and began
to develop its resources; and they succeeded in introducing
various industries and in opening up a considerable
commerce.</div></div>

<p>Under Roman sway Britain reached a high level of prosperity,
and there is abundant evidence of this fact from
Roman writers. They speak of the rich natural productions
of Britain, of its numerous flocks and herds, of its
minerals, of its various commercial facilities, and of the
revenues derived
from these sources. <span id="p002" class="xxpn">{2}</span></p>

<p>We know that there were no less than fifty-nine cities
in Britain in the middle of the third century <span class="smmaj">A.D.,</span> and the
population was probably fairly large, though we have no
certain statistics upon this
point.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn1" id="fnanc1">1</a>
Large quantities of
corn were exported from the land, as many as 800 vessels
being sent on one occasion to procure corn for the
Roman cities in Germany. This shows a fairly advanced
agriculture. Tin also was another important export, as
indeed it has always been; and British slaves were constantly
sent to the market at Rome. In the country itself
great material works, such as walled towns, paved roads,
aqueducts, and great public buildings were undertaken,
and remained to testify to the greatness of their builders
long after their name had become a distant memory.
The military system of the Romans helped to produce
industrial results, for the Roman soldiers took a prominent
part in road-making, building dykes, working
mines, and the great engineering operations that marked
the Roman rule. The chief towns very largely owed their
origin to their importance as military stations; and
most of them, such as York, London, Chester, Lincoln,
Bath, and Colchester, have continued ever since to be
considerable centres of population, though of course with
occasional fluctuations. When, however, the Romans
finally left Britain (in <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 410), both trade and agriculture
began to sink; the towns decayed; and for centuries
England became the battle-ground of various predatory
tribes from the Continent, who gradually effected a
settlement, first in many kingdoms, but finally in one,
and became known as “the English,” or the Anglo-Saxon
nationality (<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 827).</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc1" id="fn1">&#x2007;1</a>
See note 1, p. <a href="#p243" title="go to p. 243">243,</a> on Population of Roman Britain.</p>
</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Trade in the Anglo-Saxon period</h4>—But although
Egbert became Lord of the Saxons in 827, it
was not till <span id="p003" class="xxpn">{3}</span>
the reign of Edgar (958–975) that England became one
united kingdom, and indeed throughout this period internal
war was almost constant, and naturally prevented
any great growth of home industry or foreign trade.
The home industry, such as it was, was almost entirely
agricultural, under a system of which I shall speak in the
next chapter. The separate communities living in the
country villages or small towns were very much disinclined
for mutual intercourse, and endeavoured as far
as possible to be each a self-sufficing economic whole,
getting their food and clothing, coarse and rough as it
generally was, from their own flocks and herds, or from
their own land in the mark or manor.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn2" id="fnanc2">2</a>
Hence only
the simplest domestic arts and manufactures were
carried on.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc2" id="fn2">&#x2007;2</a>
See next chapter.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Internal Trade. Money</h4>—But, however much a
community may desire to be self-sufficing, it cannot be so
entirely. Differences of soil, mineral wealth, and other
advantages cause one community to require what another
has in abundance. Salt, for instance, was largely in
request for salting meat for the winter, and it cannot be
universally procured in England. Hence local markets
arose, at first always on the neutral boundary between
two marks,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn3" id="fnanc3">3</a>
the place of the market being marked by the
boundary stone, the origin of the later “market cross.”
These markets at first took place only at stated times
during the year. Shrines and burial-places of noted men
were the most frequented spots for such annual fairs.
Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, the origin of Glasgow may be traced from the
burial-place of St Ninian (<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 570). There seems to have
been a well-defined, though small, trading class; but, at
any rate at first, most people of
different occupations met <span id="p004" class="xxpn">{4}</span>
at well-known, convenient places, and bartered without
the assistance of any kind of middlemen.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc3" id="fn3">&#x2007;3</a>
See note 2, p. <a href="#p243" title="go to p. 243">243,</a> on Markets on Boundaries.</p></div>

<p>Mere barter, however, is tedious and cumbersome; and
although, up to the time of Alfred (<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 870), a large proportion,
though not the whole, of English internal trade
was carried on in this fashion, the use of metals for exchange
begins to become common in the ninth century;
and in <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 900 regular money payments by tenants are
found recorded. And when we come to the levy of the
Danegeld (<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 991)—the tax raised by Ethelred as a
bribe to the Danes—it is clear that money coinage must
have been widely diffused and in general circulation.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
Foreign Trade</h4>—Trade of all kinds had suffered a
severe blow when the Romans quitted Britain, but during
the Anglo-Saxon period English merchants still did a certain
amount of foreign trade. They were encouraged too
in this by a doom, of Danish origin,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn4" id="fnanc4">4</a>
which provided that
“if a merchant thrived so that he fared thrice over the
sea by his own means, then was he of thane-right worthy,”
which gave him a comparatively high rank. The settlement
of German merchants in London, pointing to some
continental trade, also dates from the time of Ethelred
the Unready (about <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1000). Much of this foreign
trade lay in the treasures of precious metals and embroideries,
which were imported for use in monasteries. It
is interesting, by the way, to note that St Dunstan (who
died in 988) encouraged handicraft work in metals,
especially in ironwork. The exports from England were
chiefly wool—which we shall afterwards see becomes of
great importance—some agricultural produce, and also,
as before, lead and tin. English merchants we know went
to Marseilles, and others frequented the great French
fairs of Rouen and St Denis in the
ninth century; while, <span id="p005" class="xxpn">{5}</span>
rather earlier, we have a most interesting document, our
first treaty of commerce in fact, dated <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 796, by which
Karl the Great, or Charlemagne, as some people call him,
grants protection to certain English traders from Mercia.
And in King Alfred’s days one English bishop even “penetrated
prosperously” to India with the king’s gifts to the
shrine of St Thomas.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
General Summary</h4>—Taking a general view of the
period between the Saxon Conquest and the Norman
Conquest, we see that crafts and manufactures were few
and simple, being confined as far as possible to separate
and isolated communities. Fine arts, and works in
metal and embroideries were limited to the monasteries,
which also imported them. The immense mineral
wealth of the island in iron and coal was untouched.
Trade was small, though undoubtedly developing. The
mass of the population was engaged in agriculture, and
every man had, so to speak, a stake in the land, belonging
to a manor or parish. A landless man was altogether
outside the pale of social life. The owners of the land,
and the method of its cultivation, will occupy us in the
next chapter.</div>

<div class="section padtopb">
<h3>CHAPTER II
<span class="hsmall">
THE LAND: ITS OWNERS AND CULTIVATORS</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
The Mark</h4>—We have just said that the population
of England as a whole was almost entirely engaged in
agriculture; and indeed for some centuries onward this
industry was by far the most important in the country.
Now, it is impossible to understand the conditions of this
industry without first glancing at the tenure of land as
existing about this time. It has been
thought,
but it is <span id="p006" class="xxpn">{6}</span>
not at all certain, that in very early times before the
tribes afterwards called English had crossed over to
England, or perhaps even before they had arrived in
Europe, all land was held in common by various communities
of people, perhaps at first with only a few
families in each. The land occupied by this community
(whether it was a whole tribe or a few families) had
probably been cleared away from the original forests or
wastes, and was certainly separated from all other communities
by a fixed boundary or <i>mark</i>,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn5" id="fnanc5">5</a>
whence the whole
land thus separated off was called a mark. Within this
mark was the primitive village or “township,” where
each member of the community had his house, and
where each had a common share in the land. This land
was of three kinds—(1) The <i>forest</i>, or <i>waste</i> land, from
which the mark had been originally cleared, useful for
rough natural pasture, but uncultivated. (2) The
<i>pasture</i> land, sometimes enclosed and sometimes open,
in which each mark-man looked after his own hay, and
stacked it for the winter, and which was divided into
allotments for each member. (3) The <i>arable</i> land, which
also was divided into allotments for each mark-man. To
settle any question relating to the division and use of the
land, or to any other business of common importance, the
members of the mark, or mark-men, met in a common
council called the <i>mark-moot</i>, an institution of which relics
survived for many centuries. This council, and the mark
generally, formed the political, social, and economic unit
of the early English tribes. How far it actually existed
when these tribes occupied England it is difficult to say,
and it is probable that it had already undergone considerable
transformation towards what is
called the <i>manorial</i> <span id="p007" class="xxpn">{7}</span>
system. But this much is certain, that in England, as
in Germany, traces of communal life still remain. Our
commons, still numerous in spite of hundreds of enclosures,
and the names of places ending in <i>ing</i>, which
termination frequently implies a primitive family settlement,
are evidences which remain among us to-day. And
it is only comparatively recently that the “common
fields,” yearly divided among the commoners of a parish,
together with the “three-field system,” which this
allotment involved, have disappeared from our English
agriculture.</div></div><!--section-->

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc5" id="fn5">&#x2007;5</a>
For a criticism of the mark theory see
<i>Industry in England</i>, pp. 47–61.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
The Manor</h4>—But when we come to the time when
the Anglo-Saxons had made a final settlement, and were
ruled by one king, we find a different system prevailing—<i>i.e.</i>
the manorial system. The word “manor” is a Norman
name for the Saxon “township,” or community, and
it differs from the mark in this: the mark&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn6" id="fnanc6">6</a>
was a group
of households organized and governed on a common,
democratic basis, while in the manor we find an autocratic
organization and government, whereby a group of <i>tenants</i>
acknowledge the superior position and authority of a
“lord of the manor.” But although “manor” is a
Norman name, the change from the old mark system had
taken place long before the Norman Conquest, and even
if perhaps occasional independent communities still
existed, they were completely abolished under the
Norman rule. The great feature of the manor was, that
it was subject to a “lord,” who owned absolutely a
certain portion of the land therein, and had rights of rent
(paid in services, or food, or money, or in all three) over
the rest of the land. It is probable that the lord of the
manor had gained his position under a promise of aiding
and protecting his humbler brethren; but,
even in later <span id="p008" class="xxpn">{8}</span>
times, he had to acknowledge certain rights belonging
to them.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc6" id="fn6">&#x2007;6</a>
<i>i.e.</i> supposing it ever existed.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Combined Agriculture</h4>—In the manor, just as in
the earlier stage, all agriculture was carried on collectively
by the tenants of the manor. Men gathered together
their oxen to form the usual team of eight wherewith to
drag the plough, pastured their cattle in common, and
employed a common swineherd or shepherd for their
pigs and sheep.</div>

<p>The distinctive feature of this combined agriculture
was the three-field system. All the arable land near a
village was divided into three strips, and was sown in the
following manner:—A field was sown with wheat or rye
in the autumn of one year; but owing to the slowness of
primitive farming this crop would not be reaped in time
for autumn sowing the next year, so the sowing took place
in the following spring, the next crop being oats or barley;
after this crop the land lay fallow for a year. Hence, of
these three strips, every year one had wheat or rye,
another oats or barley, while the third was fallow. The
land of each individual was necessarily scattered between
the various plots of his neighbours, so that each might
have a fair share in land of good quality. This style of
agriculture, of course, produced very meagre results, but
it seems to have been sufficient for the simple wants of the
occupiers of that epoch.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The Feudal System</h4>—In the next period we shall see
this manorial system consolidated and organized under
the Norman rule, and so may defer a full description of a
typical manor till then. Here we may say that the manor
is closely connected with the <i>feudal</i> system, which, it
must be remembered, had begun a considerable time
before the Norman Conquest. For the manor afforded
a convenient political and social unit for
the estimation of <span id="p009" class="xxpn">{9}</span>
feudal services, and the lord of the manor became more
and more a feudal chief. But it must be understood that
the manorial system was not the same as the feudal
system, though it helped to prepare the way for it; and
eventually the lords of the manors became nominally the
protectors, but really the masters of the village husbandmen
dwelling around them. The lord professed to take
them under his protection if they surrendered their
independence to him, and it was probably owing to the
frequent incursions of the Danes that the system grew as
it did. In Canute’s reign we find it in full force, for at
this time the kingdom was divided into great military
districts, or <i>earldoms</i>, the “earl” being responsible to
the king and receiving the profits of his district. When
William the Norman conquered England he did not, as is
often supposed, impose a feudal system upon the people.
The system was there already, developed from the old
manors, and all William I. did was to reorganize it, and
give the English people Norman instead of Anglo-Saxon
or Danish lords.</div>

<p id="note-pg9"><span class="smcap">N<b>OTE</b></span>.—The
theory of the mark (which is now regarded as very
doubtful) is dealt with more fully in ch. iv. of my <i>Industry in
England</i>, where also the evidences of communal village life are
discussed; and I must refer my readers to this for more recent
views.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I
<span class="hsmall">
DOMESDAY BOOK AND THE MANORS</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
Domesday Book</h4>—It was very natural that, when
William the Norman conquered England, he should wish
to ascertain the capabilities of his kingdom both in regard
to military defence and for taxation; and that he
should endeavour to gain a comprehensive idea of the
results of his conquest. So he ordered a grand survey of
the kingdom to be made, and sent commissioners into
each district to make it. These officials were bidden to
inquire about all the estates in the realm—who held them,
what was the value of each, how many men occupied it
and how many cattle each supported. The results of
this survey form our earliest and most reliable statistics
for English industrial history; and it is to be regretted
that no general table or analysis of this great work has
yet been made, or that historians do not use it more
copiously for gaining a knowledge of the social and
economic conditions of the time. For this latter purpose
it is absolutely unrivalled.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn7" id="fnanc7">7</a></div>

<div class="dftnt">

<a href="#p242" title="go to p. 242">242.</a></p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Economic condition of the country as shown in
Domesday</h4>—From it we may gather the
following few facts <span id="p011" class="xxpn">{11}</span>
as to the economic condition of England about the time of
the Norman Conquest. The population numbered about
2,000,000, three-fourths of whom lived by agricultural
labour, the remaining fourth being townsfolk, gentry, and
churchmen. The East and South, especially the county
of Kent, were the best tilled, richest, and most populous
parts of the country. “The downs and wolds gave fine
pasturage for sheep, the copses and woods formed
fattening grounds for swine, and the hollows at the
downs’ foot, the river flats, and the low, gravel hills, were
the best and easiest land to plough and crop. Far the
largest part of the country was forest—<i>i.e.</i> uncleared and
undrained moor, wood, or fen.”&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn8" id="fnanc8">8</a>
The chief towns were
London, Canterbury, Chester, Lincoln, Oxford, York,
Hereford, and Winchester; but these were trading
centres rather than seats of manufacturing industry. A
small foreign export trade was done in wool and lead, the
imports being chiefly articles of luxury. There were 9250
villages or manors in the land; in these about three-fifths
of each is waste—<i>i.e.</i> untilled, common land—one-fifth
pasture, and one-fifth arable.</div>

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc8" id="fn8">&#x2007;8</a>
V. <i>Industry in England</i>, p. 69.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
The Manors and their owners</h4>—Now each of these
manors after the Norman Conquest was held by a “lord,”
who held it more or less remotely from the king. For it is
the distinguishing feature of the Conquest, that William
the Norman made himself the supreme landlord of the
country, so that all land was held under him. He himself
of course held a good many manors, which were
farmed by his bailiffs, and for each of these manors he
was the lord. But the majority of the manors were held
by his followers, the Norman nobles, and nearly all of
them had several manors apiece. Now it was impossible
for a noble to look after all his manors
himself, and they <span id="p012" class="xxpn">{12}</span>
found it was not always the best plan to put their bailiffs
in to work them; so they used to sublet some of their
manors to other tenants, often to Englishmen who had
submitted to the Norman Conquest. The nobles who
held the land direct from the king were called <i>tenants in
chief</i>,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn9" id="fnanc9">9</a>
the tenants to whom they sublet it were called
<i>tenants in mesne</i>.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn10" id="fnanc10">10</a>
If a noble let a manor to a tenant in
mesne the tenant then took his place, and became the
<i>lord</i> of the manor. Thus, then, we have some manors
owned directly by the king, others by the great nobles,
and others again by tenants in mesne. For instance, in
the part of Domesday relating to Oxfordshire, we find
that one Milo Crispin, a tenant in chief, held several
manors from the king, but also let some of them to sub-tenants,
that of Cuxham, <i>e.g.</i>, being let to one Alured, who
was therefore its lord. So in Warwickshire the manor of
Estone (now Aston) was one of those belonging to William
Fitz-Ansculf, but he had let it to Godmund, an Englishman,
who was then “lord of the manor of Estone.”</div>

<i>i.e.</i> sub-tenants.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The inhabitants of the manors</h4>—Besides the lord
himself (whether king, noble, or sub-tenant), with his
personal retainers, and generally a parish priest or some
monks, there were three other classes of inhabitants.
(1) First came the <i>villeins</i>, who formed 38 per cent. of the
whole population recorded in Domesday, and who held
their land in virgates, a <i>virgate</i> being some thirty acres of
arable land, scattered of course in plots (cf.
p. <a href="#p020" title="go to p. 20">20</a>) among
the common fields of the manor, together with a house
and messuage in the village. These villeins were often
called <i>virgarii</i> (or <i>yardlings</i>), from this term virgate.
(2) Below the villeins came the <i>cottars</i>, or <i>bordars</i>, a class
distinct from and below the former,
who probably held <span id="p013" class="xxpn">{13}</span>
only some five or ten acres of land and a cottage, and did
not even possess a plough, much less a team of oxen,
apiece, but had to combine among themselves for the
purpose of ploughing. They form 32 per cent. of the
Domesday population. Finally came (3) <i>the slaves</i>, who
were much smaller in numbers than is commonly supposed,
forming only 9 per cent. of the Domesday population.
Less than a century after the Conquest these
disappear and merge into the cottars.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
The condition of these inhabitants</h4>—The chief
feature of the social condition of these classes of people
was that they were subject to a lord. They each
depended upon a superior, and no man could be either
lordless or landless; for all persons in <i>villeinage</i>, which
included everyone below the lord of the manor, were
subject to a master, and bound to the land, except, of
course, “free tenants” (p. <a href="#p015" title="go to p. 15">15</a>). But even against their
lord the villeins had certain rights which had to be recognized.
They had, moreover, many comforts and little
responsibility, except to pay their dues to their lord.
Moreover, it was possible for a villein to purchase a remission
of his services, and become a “free tenant.” Or
he might become such by residing in a town for a year
and a day, and being a member of a town gild, as long as
during that period he was unclaimed by his lord. And
in course of time the villein’s position came to be this—he
owed his lord the customary services (see p. <a href="#p014" title="go to p. 14">14</a>) whereby
his lord’s land was cultivated; but his lord could not
refuse him his customary rights in return—“his house
and lands, and rights of wood and hay”—and in relation
to everyone but his lord he was a perfectly free citizen.
His condition tended to improve, and up to the time of
the Great Plague (1348) a large number of villeins had
become actually free, having
commuted their services <span id="p014" class="xxpn">{14}</span>
for money payments. What these services were we shall
now explain. But finally, we wish to point out that
the state of villeinage and of serfage was practically the
same thing in two aspects; the first implying the fact
that the villein was bound to the soil, the second that he
was subject to a master. A serf was not a slave; and,
as we saw above, <i>slaves</i> became extinct soon after the
Norman Conquest.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Services due to the lord from his tenants in villeinage</h4>—Under
the manorial system rent was paid in a very
different manner from that in which it is paid to-day, for
it was a rent not so much of money, though that was
employed, as of services. The services thus rendered by
tenants in villeinage, whether villeins or cottars, may be
divided into <i>week-work</i>, and <i>boon-days</i> or work on special
days. The week-work consisted of ploughing or reaping,
or doing some other agricultural work for the lord of the
manor for two or three days in the week, or at fixed
times, such as at harvest; while <i>boon-day</i> work was
rendered at times not fixed, but whenever the lord of the
manor might require it, though the number of boon-days
in a year was limited. When, however, the villein or
cottar had performed these liabilities, he was quite free
to do work on his own land, or for that matter on any
one else’s land, as indeed the cottars frequently did, for
they had not much land of their own, and so often had
time and labour to spare. It was from this cottar class
with time to spare that a distinct wage-earning class,
like our modern labourers, arose, who lived almost
entirely by wages. We shall hear more of them later on;
but at the time of the Conquest they hardly existed.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
Money payments and rents</h4>—It was also usual for
a tenant, besides rendering these servile services, to pay
his lord a small rent either in money
or kind, generally <span id="p015" class="xxpn">{15}</span>
in both. Thus on Cuxham manor we find a villein (or
serf) paying his lord ½<i>d.</i> on November 12th every year and
1<i>d.</i> whenever he brews. He also pays, in kind, 1 quarter
of seed-wheat at Michaelmas; 1 peck of wheat, 4 bushels
of oats, and 3 hens on 12th November; also 1 cock and
2 hens, and 2<i>d.</i> worth of bread every Christmas. His
<i>services</i> are—to plough and till ½ acre of the lord’s land,
to give 3 days’ labour at harvest, and other days when
required by the bailiff. This was the rent for about 12
or 15 acres of land (half a virgate), and upon a calculation
of the worth of labour and provisions at that time
(end of thirteenth century) comes to about 6<i>d.</i> an acre
for his land, and 3<i>s.</i> a year for his house and the land
about it (<i>curtilage</i>).</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
Free Tenants. Soke-men</h4>—So far I have been
speaking only about tenants in villeinage. But in the
Domesday Book we find another class of tenants, called
<i>free</i>, who had to pay a rent fixed in amount, either in
money or kind, and sometimes in labour. This rent was
fixed and unalterable in amount, and they were masters
of their own actions as soon as it was paid. They were
not, like the villeins, bound to the soil, but could transfer
their holdings or even quit the manor if they liked.
They were, however, subject to their lord’s jurisdiction
in matters of law, and hence were called <i>soke-men</i> (from
<i>soke</i> or <i>soc</i> = jurisdiction exercised by a lord). They also
were bound to give military service when called upon,
which the villeinage tenants had not to give. If they
had any services to render, these were generally commuted
into money payments; and here we may observe,
that there was a constant tendency from the Conquest
to the time of the Great Plague (1348) towards this commutation.
Villeins also could, and did frequently,
commute their labour rents
for money rents. <span id="p016" class="xxpn">{16}</span></div>

<p>In Domesday, we find that the Eastern and East-central
counties were those in which “free” tenants or
soke-men were most prevalent. There they form from
27 to 45 per cent. of the inhabitants of those parts,
though, taking all England into view, they only form 4 per
cent. of the total population. The number of free tenants,
however, was constantly increasing, even among tenants
in villeinage, for the lord often found it more useful to
have money, and was willing to allow commutation of
services; or again, he might prefer not to cultivate <i>all</i>
his own land (his <i>demesne</i>), but to let it for a fixed money
rent to a villein to do what he could with it; and thus the
villein became a free man, while the lord was sure of a
fixed sum from his land every year, whether the harvest
were good or bad.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 9.</span>
Illustrations of old manors. (1) Estone</h4>—To make
clear what I have said in this chapter, it will perhaps be
well to give two illustrations drawn from the Domesday
Book (eleventh century) and from bailiffs’ accounts of a
later period (end of thirteenth century).</div>

<p>First we will take a manor in Warwickshire in the
Domesday Survey (1089)—Estone, now Aston, near Birmingham.
It was one of a number belonging to William,
the son of Ansculf, who was tenant in chief, but had let it
to one Godmund, a sub-tenant in mesne. The Survey
runs: “William Fitz-Ansculf holds of the King Estone,
and Godmund of him. There are 8 hides.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn11" id="fnanc11">11</a>
The arable
employs 20 ploughs; in the demesne the arable employs
6 ploughs, but now there are no ploughs. There are 30
villeins with a priest, and 1 bondsman, and 12 bordars
[<i>i.e.</i> cottars]. They have 18 ploughs.
A mill pays 3 <span id="p017" class="xxpn">{17}</span>
shillings. The woodland is 3 miles long and half a mile
broad. It was worth £4; now 100 shillings.”</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc11" id="fn11">11</a>
A <i>hide</i> varied in size, and was (after the
Conquest) equal to a <i>carucate</i>, which might be anything
from 80 to 120 or 180 acres. Perhaps 120 is a fair average,
though some say 80.</p></div>

<p>Here we have a good example of a manor held by a sub-tenant,
and containing all the three classes mentioned in
§ 4 of this chapter—villeins, cottars, and slaves (<i>i.e.</i> bondsmen).
The whole manor must have been about 5000
acres, of which 1000 were probably arable land, which was
of course parcelled out in strips among the villeins, the
lord, and the priest. As there were only 18 ploughs
among 30 villeins, it is evident some of them at least had
to use a plough and oxen in common. The demesne land
does not seem to have been well cultivated by Godmund
the lord, for there were no ploughs on it, though it was
large enough to employ six. Perhaps Godmund, being
an Englishman, had been fighting the Normans in the
days of Harold, and had let it go out of cultivation, or
perhaps the former owner had died in the war, and Godmund
had rented the land from the Norman noble to
whom William gave it.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 10.</span>
Cuxham Manor in the eleventh and thirteenth
centuries</h4>—Our second illustration can be described at two
periods of its existence—at the time of Domesday and 200
years later. It was only a small manor of some 490 acres,
and was held by a sub-tenant from a Norman tenant in
chief, Milo Crispin. It is found in the Oxfordshire Domesday,
in the list of lands belonging to Milo Crispin. The
Survey says: “Alured [the sub-tenant] now holds 5 hides
for a manor in Cuxham. Land to 4 ploughs; now in the
demesne, 2 ploughs and 4 bondsmen. And 7 villeins with
4 bordars have 3 ploughs. There are 3 mills of 18 shillings;
and 18 acres of meadow. It was worth £3, now
£6.” Here, again, our three classes of villeins, cottars or
bordars, and slaves are represented. The manor was
evidently a good one, for though smaller
than Estone it <span id="p018" class="xxpn">{18}</span>
was worth more, and has three mills and good meadow
land as well. Now, by the end of the thirteenth century
this manor had passed into the hands of Merton College,
Oxford, which then represented the lord, but farmed it by
means of a bailiff. Professor Thorold Rogers gives us a
description of it,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn12" id="fnanc12">12</a>
drawn from the annual accounts of this
bailiff, which he has examined along with a number of
others from other manors. We find one or two changes
have taken place, for the bondsmen have entirely disappeared,
as indeed they did in less than a century after the
Conquest all through the land. The number of villeins
and bordars has increased. There are now 13 villeins and
8 cottars, and 1 free tenant. There is also a prior, who
holds land (6 acres) in the manor but does not live in it;
also two other tenants, who do not live in the manor, but
hold “a quarter of a knight’s fee” (here some 40 or 50
acres)—a knight’s fee comprising an area of land varying
from 2 hides to 4 or even 6 hides, but in any case worth
some £20. As the Cuxham land was good, the quantity
necessary for the valuation of a fee would probably be only
the small hide or carucate of 80 acres, and the quarter of it
of course 20 acres or a little more. The 13 serfs hold 170
acres, but the 8 cottars only 30 acres, including their tenements.
The free tenant holds 12&#x2060;¾ acres, and Merton
College as lord of the manor some 240 acres of demesne.
There are now two mills instead of three, one belonging to
the prior, and the other to another tenant. There were
altogether, counting the families of the villeins and
cottars, but not the two tenants of military fees, about
60 or 70 inhabitants, the most important being the college
bailiff and the miller.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 11.</span>
Description of a manor village</h4>—Now in both
these country manors, as in all others,
the central feature <span id="p019" class="xxpn">{19}</span>
would be the dwelling of the lord, or manor-house. It
was substantially built, and served as a court-house for
the annual sittings of the <i>court baron</i> and <i>court leet</i>.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn13" id="fnanc13">13</a>
If
the lord did not live in it, his bailiff did so, and then the
lord would come once or twice a year to hold these courts.
Near the manor-house generally stood the church, often
large for the size of the village, because the nave was frequently
used as a town-hall for meetings or for markets.
Then there would be the house of the priest, possibly in
the demesne; and after these two the most important
building was the mill, which, if there was a stream, would
be placed on its banks in order to use the water-power.
The rest of the tenants generally inhabited the principal
street or road of the village, near the stream, if one ran
through the place. The houses of these villages were
poor and dirty, not always made of stone, and never (till
the fifteenth century) of brick, but built of posts wattled
and plastered with clay or mud, with an upper storey of
poles reached by a ladder. The articles of furniture
would be very coarse and few, being necessarily of home
manufacture; a few rafters or poles overhead, a bacon-rack,
and agricultural tools being the most conspicuous
objects. Chimneys were unknown, except in the manor-houses,
and so too were windows, and the floor was of bare
earth. Outside the door was the “mixen,” a collection
of every kind of manure and refuse, which must have
rendered the village street alike unsavoury, unsightly
and unwholesome. But though their life was rude and
rough, it seems that the villagers were fairly happy, and,
considering all things, about as well off as are their descendants
now.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 12.</span>
The kinds of land in a manor</h4>—Before concluding
this chapter, it is necessary, in order
to complete our <span id="p020" class="xxpn">{20}</span>
sketch of the manorial system from the time of the Conquest
onwards, to understand how the land was divided
up. We may say that there were seven kinds of land
altogether, (1) First came the lord’s land round about
the manor-house, the <i>demesne</i> land, which was strictly
his own, and generally cultivated by himself or his
bailiff. All other land held by tenants was called <i>land in
villeinage</i>. (2) Next came the arable land of the village
held by the tenants in <i>common fields</i>. Now these fields
were all divided up into many strips, and tenants held
their strips generally in quite different places, all mixed
up anyhow (cf. diagram, where the tenants are marked
A, B. C, etc.). The lord and the parson might also have
a few strips in these fields. There were at least three
fields, in order to allow the rotation of crops mentioned
before (p. <a href="#p008" title="go to p. 8">8</a>). Each tenant held his strip only till harvest,
after which all fences and divisions were taken away, and
the cattle turned out to feed on the stubble. (3) Thirdly
came the <i>common pasture</i>, for all the tenants. But each
tenant was restricted or stinted in the number of cattle
that he might pasture, lest he should put on too many,
and thus not leave enough food for his neighbours’ cattle.
Sometimes, however, we find pasture without stint, as in
Port Meadow at Oxford to this day. (4) Then comes the
<i>forest</i> or <i>woodland</i>, as in Estone, which belonged to the
lord, who owned all the timber. But the tenants had
rights, such as the right of lopping and topping certain
trees, collecting fallen branches for fuel; and the right of
“pannage”—<i>i.e.</i> of turning cattle, especially swine, into
the woods to pick up what food they could. (5) There
was also in most manors what is called the <i>waste</i>—<i>i.e.</i> uncultivated—land,
affording rough pasture, and on which
the tenants had the right of cutting turf and bracken
for fuel and fodder. Then near the
stream there would <span id="p021" class="xxpn">{21}</span></div>

<p id="p022" class="pcontinue">perhaps
be some (6) <i>Meadow land</i>, as at Cuxham; but this
always belonged to the lord, and if he let it out, he always
charged an extra rent (say eightpence instead of sixpence
an acre), for it was very valuable as affording a good
supply of hay for the winter. Lastly, if the tenant could
afford it, and wanted to have other land besides the common
fields, where he could let his cattle lie, or to cultivate
the ground more carefully, he could occupy (7) a <i>close</i>, or
a portion of land specially marked off and let separately.
The lord always had a close on his demesne, and the chief
tenants would generally have one or two as well. The
close land was of course rented more highly than land in
the common fields.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II
<span class="hsmall">
THE TOWNS AND THE GILDS</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
The origin of towns</h4>—As in the case of the manor,
which was the Norman name for the Saxon “townships,”
the town, in the modern sense of the word, had its origin
from the primitive settlement known as the mark (p. <a href="#p006" title="go to p. 6">6</a>).
The only difference between a town and a manor originally
lay in the number of its population, and in the fact that
the town was a more defensible
place than the <span id="p023" class="xxpn">{23}</span>
“township,” or rural manor, probably having a mound or moat
surrounding it, instead of the hedges which ran round the
villages. In itself it was merely a manor or group of
manors; as Professor Freeman puts it, “one part of the
district where men lived closer together than elsewhere.”
The town had at first a constitution like that of a primitive
village in the mark, but its inhabitants had gradually
gained certain rights and functions of a special nature.
These rights and privileges had been received from the
lord of the manor on which the town had grown up; for
towns, especially provincial towns, were at first only
dependent manors, which gained safety and solidity under
the protection of some great noble, prelate, or the king
himself, who finally would grant the town thus formed a
charter.</div></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Rise of towns in England</h4>—Towns first became important
in England towards the end of the Saxon period
Saxon England had never been a settlement of towns,
but of villages and townships, or manors. But gradually
towns did grow up, though differing widely in the circumstances
and manner of their rise. Some grew up in the
fortified camps of the invaders themselves, as being in a
secure position; some arose from a later occupation of
the once sacked and deserted Roman towns. Many grew
silently in the shadow of a great abbey or monastery. Of
this class was Oxford, which first came into being round
the monasteries of St Frideswide and Osney. Others
clustered round the country houses of some Saxon king or
earl. Several important boroughs owed their rise to the
convenience of their site as a port or a trading centre.
This was the origin of the growth of Bristol, whose rise
resulted directly from trade; and London of course had
always been a port of high commercial rank. A few
other towns, like Scarborough and Grimsby,
were at first <span id="p024" class="xxpn">{24}</span>
small havens for fishermen. But all the English towns
were far less flourishing before the arrival of the Normans
than they afterwards became.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Towns in Domesday: London</h4>—If, now, we once
more go back to our great authority, the survey made by
William the Norman, we find that the status of these
towns or boroughs is clearly recognized, though they are
regarded as held by the lord of the manor “in demesne,”
or in default of a lord, as part of the king’s demesne.
Thus Northampton at that time was a town in the king’s
demesne; Beverley was held in demesne by the Archbishop
of York. It was possible, too, that one town
might belong to several lords, because it spread over, or
was an aggregate of, several manors or townships. Thus
Leicester seems to have included four manors, which were
thus held in demesne by four lords—one by the king,
another by the Bishop of Lincoln, another by a noble,
Simon de Senlis, and the fourth by Ivo of Grantmesnil,
the sheriff. In later times it was held under one lord,
Count Robert of Meulan.</div>

<p>Now, in the Domesday Book there is mention made of
forty-one provincial cities or boroughs, most of them
being the county towns of the present day. There are
also ten fortified towns of greater importance than the
others. They are Canterbury, York, Nottingham, Oxford,
Hereford, Leicester, Lincoln, Stafford, Chester, and
Colchester. London was a town apart, as it had always
been, and was the only town which had a civic constitution,
being regulated by a port-reeve and a bishop, and
having a kind of charter, though afterwards the privileges
of this charter were much increased. London was
of course a great port and trading centre, and had many
foreign merchants in it. It was then, as well as in subsequent
centuries, the centre of English
national life, and <span id="p025" class="xxpn">{25}</span>
the voice of its citizens counted for something in national
affairs. The other great ports of England at that time
were Bristol, Southampton, and Norwich, and as trade
grew and prospered, many other ports rose into prominence
(see p. <a href="#p064" title="go to p. 64">64</a>).</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
Special privileges of towns</h4>—Even at the time of
the Conquest most towns, though small, were of sufficient
importance to have a certain status of their own, with
definite privileges. The most important of these was the
right of composition for taxation, <i>i.e.</i> the right of paying
a fixed sum, or rent, to the Crown, instead of the various
tallages, taxes, and imposts that might be required of
other places. This fixed sum, or composition, was called
the <i>firma burgi</i>, and by the time of the Conquest was
nearly always paid in money. Previously it had been
paid both in money and kind, for we find Oxford paying
to Edward the Confessor six sectaries of honey as well as
£20 in coin; while to William the Norman it paid £60 as
an inclusive lump sum. By the end of the Norman period
all the towns had secured the <i>firma burgi</i>, and the right of
assessing it themselves, instead of being assessed by the
sheriff; they had the right also of choosing a mayor of
their own, instead of the king’s bailiff or <i>reeve</i>. They
had, moreover, their own tribunals, a charter for their
customs, and special rules of local administration, and,
generally speaking, gained entire judicial and commercial
freedom.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
How the towns obtained their charters</h4>—It is
interesting to see what circumstances helped forward this
emancipation of the towns from the rights possessed by
the nobles and the abbeys, or by the king. The chief
cause of the readiness of the nobles and kings to grant
charters during this period (from the Conquest to Henry
III.) was their lack of ready
money. Everyone knows <span id="p026" class="xxpn">{26}</span>
how fiercely the nobles fought against each other in
Stephen’s reign, and how enthusiastically they rushed
to the Crusades under Richard I. They could not indulge
their love of fighting, which in their eyes was their main
duty, without money to pay for their fatal extravagances
in this direction, and to get money they frequently parted
with their manorial rights over the towns that had grown
up on their estates. Especially was this the case when a
noble, or king, was taken prisoner, and wanted the means
of his ransom. In this way Portsmouth and Norwich
gained their charters by paying part of Richard I.’s
ransom (1194). Again, Rye and Winchelsea gained
theirs by supplying the same king (in 1191) with two
ships for one of his Eastern crusades. Many other
instances might be quoted from the cases of nobles who
also gave charters when setting out upon these extraordinary
religious and sentimental expeditions. Indeed, the
Crusades had a very marked influence in this way upon
the growth of English towns. Someone had to pay for
the wars in which the aristocracy delighted, and it is well
to remember the fact that the expenses of all our wars—and
they have been both numerous and costly—have been
defrayed by the industrial portion of the community.
And the glories and cruelties of that savage age of so-called
knightly chivalry, which has been idealized and
gilded by romancers and history-mongers, with its tournaments
and torture-chambers, were paid for by that
despised industrial population of the towns and manors
which contained the real life and wealth of mediæval
England.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
The gilds and the towns. Various kinds of gilds</h4>—But
besides the indirect effect of the Crusades, there was
another powerful factor in the growth and emancipation
of the towns after the Conquest. I refer
to the <i>merchant</i> <span id="p027" class="xxpn">{27}</span>
<i>gilds</i>, which were becoming more and more prominent all
through this period, though the height of their power was
reached in the fourteenth century. These merchant gilds
were one out of four other kinds of gilds, all of which seem
to have been similar in origin. The earliest gilds are
found in Saxon times, and were very much what we understand
by clubs. At first they were associations of men
for more or less religious and charitable purposes, and
formed a sort of artificial family, whose members were
bound by the bond not of kinship, but of an oath; while
the gild-feast, held once a month in the common hall,
replaced the family gatherings of kinsfolk. These gilds
were found both in towns and manors, but chiefly in the
former, where men were brought more closely together.
Besides (1) the <i>religious</i> gilds, we find in Saxon times (2)
the <i>frith</i> gilds, formed for mutual assistance in case of
violence, wrong, or false accusation, or in any legal affairs.
But this class of gilds died out after the Conquest. The
most important were (3) the <i>merchant</i> gilds mentioned
above, which existed certainly in Edward the Confessor’s
time, being called in Saxon <i>ceapemanne</i> gilds, and they
were recognized at the time of the Conquest, for they are
recorded in Domesday here and there as possessing lands.
The merchant members of these gilds had various privileges,
such as a monopoly of the local trade of a town, and
freedom from certain imposts. They had a higher rank
than the members of the (4) <i>craft</i> gilds. These last were
associations of handicraftsmen, or artisans, and were
separate from the merchant gilds, though also of great
importance. If a town was large enough, each craft or
manufacture had a gild of its own, though in smaller
towns members of various crafts would form only one
gild. Such gilds were found, too, not only in towns but
in country villages, as is known, <i>e.g.</i>, in the
case of some <span id="p028" class="xxpn">{28}</span>
Norfolk villages, and remains of their halls in villages have
been found. Their gild feasts are probably represented to
this day in the parish feasts, survivals of ancient custom.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
How the Merchant Gilds helped the growth of
towns</h4>—Now it was only natural that the existence of
these powerful associations in the growing boroughs
should secure an increasing extent of cohesion and unity
among the townsmen. Moreover, the craft and merchant
gilds had a very important privilege, which could make
many men anxious to join their ranks, namely, that membership
in a gild for a year and a day made a tenant in
villeinage a free man, as were all the members of a gild.
Thus the gilds included all the free tenants in a town, and
in becoming a merchant gild the body of free citizens, who
formed the only influential portion of a town, began to
enlarge their municipal powers. It became their special
endeavour to obtain from the king or from their lord
wider commercial privileges, grants of coinage, of holding
fairs, and of exemption from tolls. Then they asked for
freedom of justice and of self-government; and more
especially did the gilds, as representing practically the
town, buy up the <i>firma burgi</i>, or fixed tax, and thus became
their own assessors, and finally bought a charter, as
we have seen, from a king or noble in need of ready money.
And so gradually, and by other steps which are not always
clear, the emancipation of the towns was won by the gilds;
the boroughs became free from their lords’ restrictions
and dues; till by the end of the twelfth century chartered
towns, which were very few at the time of the Conquest,
became the general rule.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
How the Craft Gilds helped industry</h4>—So far we
have specially noted the work of the merchant gilds,
which, as it were, built up the constitution and freedom
of the towns. <span id="p029" class="xxpn">{29}</span></div>

<p>We must now look for a moment at the work of the
artisans’ gilds, or craft gilds, which afterwards became
very important. These gilds are found not only in London,
but in provincial towns. The London weavers are
mentioned as a craft gild in the time of Henry I. (<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span>
1100), and most of these gilds seemed to have existed
already for a long period. The Goldsmiths’ Gild claimed
to have possessed land before the Norman Conquest, and
it was fairly powerful in the days of Henry II. (<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1154),
for he found it convenient to try and suppress it. But it
did not receive the public recognition of a charter till the
fourteenth century. They arose, of course, first in the
towns, and originally seem to have consisted of a small
body of the leading men of a particular craft, to whom
was confided the regulation of a particular industry,
probably as soon as that industry was thought of sufficient
importance to be regulated. The gild tried to
secure good work on the part of its members, and attempted
to suppress the production of wares by irresponsible
persons who were not members of the craft.
Their fundamental principle was, that a member should
work not only for his own private advantage, but for
the reputation and good of his trade; hence bad
work was punished, and it is curious to note that
night-work is prohibited as leading to poor work.
The gild took care to secure a supply of competent
workmen for the future by training young people in
its particular industry, and hence arose the <i>apprentice
system</i>, which at first, at any rate, had considerable
advantages.</p>

<p>The gild, moreover, exercised a moral control over its
members, and secured their good behaviour, thus forming
an effective branch of the social police. On the other
hand, it had many of the characteristics
of a benefit <span id="p030" class="xxpn">{30}</span>
society, providing against sickness and death among those
belonging to it, as indeed all gilds did.</p>

<p>These institutions, however, did not only belong to the
towns, but were found in country districts also; thus we
hear of the carpenters’ and masons’ rural gilds in the reign
of Edward III. Even the peasant labourers, according to
Professor Thorold Rogers, possessed these associations,
which in all cases served many of the functions of the
modern trade unions. Later on (1381) we shall come to a
very remarkable instance of the power of these peasants’
unions in the matter of Tyler’s rebellion.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 9.</span>
Life in the towns of this time</h4>—The inhabitants of
the towns were of all classes of society. There was the
noble who held the castle, or the abbot and monks in the
monastery, with their retainers and personal dependants;
there were the busy merchants, active both in the management
of their trade and of civic affairs; and there were
artisans and master workmen in different crafts. There
were free tenants, or <i>tenants in socage</i>, including all the
burgesses, or burgage-tenants, as they were called; and
there was the lower class of villeins, which, however,
always tended to rise into free men as they were admitted
into the gilds. “To and fro went our forefathers
in the quiet, quaint, narrow streets, or worked at some
handicraft in their houses, or exposed their goods round
the market-cross. And in those old streets and houses,
in the town-mead and market-place, amid the murmur of
the mill beside the stream, and the notes of the bell that
sounded its summons to the crowded assembly of the
town-mote, in merchant gild and craft gild, was growing
up that sturdy, industrial life, unheeded and unnoticed by
knight or baron, that silently and surely was building up
the slow structure of England’s wealth and freedom.”&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn15" id="fnanc15">15</a></div>

Economic effects of the Feudal System</h4>—We shall
find that for some time after the Norman Conquest English
industry does not develop very rapidly, and that for
obvious reasons. The feud that existed between Norman
and Saxon—although perhaps partially allayed by
Henry I.’s marriage to an English wife—and the social
disorder that accompanied this feeling, hardly tended to
that quiet and security that are necessary for a healthy
industrial life. The frightful disorders that occurred
during the fierce struggle for the kingdom between
Stephen of Blois and the Empress Maud, and the equally
frightful ravages and extortions of their contending
barons, must have been serious drawbacks to any progress.
As the old annalist remarks—“They fought
among themselves with deadly hatred; they spoiled the
fairest lands with fire and rapine; in what had been the
most fertile of counties they destroyed almost all the provision
of bread.”&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn16" id="fnanc16">16</a>
But this mighty struggle fortunately
ended in ruining many of the barons who took part in it,
and in the desirable destruction of most of their abodes of
plunder. And the accession of Henry II. (1154) marks a
period of amalgamation between Englishmen and Normans,
not only in social life, but in commercial traffic and
intercourse.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc16" id="fn16">16</a>
Quoted by Green; <i>History</i>, I. 155.</p></div></div><!--section-->

<p>But even when we come to look at the feudal system in
a time of peace, we see that it did not tend to any great
growth of industry. For it encouraged rather than
diminished that spirit of
isolation and self-sufficiency <span id="p032" class="xxpn">{32}</span>
which was so marked a feature of the earlier manors and
townships, where, again, little scope was afforded to individual
enterprise, from the fact that the consent of the
lord of a manor or town was often necessary for the most
ordinary purposes of industrial life. It is true, as we have
seen, that when the noble owner was in pecuniary difficulties
the towns profited thereby to obtain their charters;
and perhaps we may not find it altogether a matter for
regret that the barons, through their internecine struggles,
thus unwittingly helped on the industry of the land. It
may be admitted also, that though the isolation of
communities consequent upon the prevalent manorial
system did not encourage trade and traffic between
separate communities, it yet tended to diffuse a knowledge
of domestic manufactures throughout the land
generally, because each place had largely to provide
for itself.</p>

<p>The constant taxation, however, entailed by the feudal
system in the shape of tallages, aids, and fines, both to
king and nobles, made it difficult for the lower classes to
accumulate capital, more especially as in the civil wars
they were constantly plundered of it openly. The upper
classes merely squandered it in fighting. Agriculture
suffered similarly; for the villeins, however well off, were
bound to the land, especially in the earlier period soon
after the Conquest, and before commutation of services
for money rents became so common as it did subsequently;
nor could they leave their manor without incurring
a distinct loss, both of social status and—what
is more important—of the means of livelihood. The
systems of constant services to the lord of the manor, and
of the collective methods of cultivation, were also drawbacks
to good agriculture. Again, in trade, prices were
settled by authority, competition
was unduly checked, <span id="p033" class="xxpn">{33}</span>
and merchants had to pay heavy fines for royal “protection.”</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Foreign Trade. The Crusades</h4>—But, on the other
hand, the Norman Conquest, which combined the Kingdom
of England with the Duchy of Normandy in close
political relations, gave abundant opportunities for commerce,
both with France and the Continent, and foreign
trade certainly received a stimulus from this fact. It was
further developed by the Crusades. The most obvious
effect of these remarkable expeditions for a visionary
success was the opening up of Trade Routes throughout
Europe to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, and to the
East in general. They produced also a considerable
redistribution of wealth in England itself, for the knights
and nobles that set out for the Holy Land often mortgaged
their lands and never redeemed them, or they
perished and their lands lapsed to the crown, or to some
monastery that took the place of a trustee for the absent
owner. The growth of towns also, as we saw, is directly
attributable to the privileges and freedom secured at this
time by supplying money to a crusading lord. As to
foreign trade, our chief authority at this time is the old
chronicler, Henry of Huntingdon, whose history was published
about <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1155. Like most historians, even of the
present day, he says very little about so insignificant a
matter as trade; but the single sentence which he devotes
to it is probably of as great value as any other part
of his book. From it we gather that our trade with
Germany was extensive, and that we exported lead and
tin among the metals; fish and meat and fat cattle
(which seems to point to some improvement in our
pastoral economy); and, most important of all, fine wool,
though at that time the English could not weave it properly
for themselves. Our imports,
however, are very <span id="p034" class="xxpn">{34}</span>
limited, comprising none of the necessities of life, and
few of its luxuries beyond silver and foreign furs. Other
imports were fine woven cloths, used for the dresses of the
nobility; and, after the Crusades began, of rich Eastern
stuffs and spices, which were in great demand, and commanded
a high price. So too did iron, which was necessary
for agricultural purposes, as Englishmen had not yet
discovered their rich stores of this metal, but had to get
it from the lands on the Baltic shore. Generally speaking,
we may say that our imports consisted of articles
of greater intrinsic value and scarcity than our exports,
and thus were fewer in number, though of course
balancing in total value, as imports and exports always
must.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
The trading clauses in the Great Charter</h4>—One
great proof of the existence of a fair amount of foreign
trade is seen in the clauses which were inserted in the
Great Charter (1215), by the influence of the trading
class. One enactment secures to foreign merchants
freedom of journeying and of trade throughout the realm,
and another orders a uniformity of weights and measures
to be enforced throughout the whole kingdom. The
growth of home industry in the towns is seen in the
enactment which secures to the towns the enjoyment of
their municipal privileges, their freedom from arbitrary
taxation, and the regulation of their own trade. The
forfeiture of a freeman, even upon conviction of felony,
was never to include his wares, if he were a merchant.
The exactions of forced labour by the royal officers was
also forbidden, and this must have been a great boon
to the agricultural population. There is also a clause
which endeavours to restrict usury exacted by the Jews,
a clause which points to the usual characteristics of the
Hebrew race, and which shows
their growing importance <span id="p035" class="xxpn">{35}</span>
in economic England. We will therefore briefly mention
the facts concerning them at this period.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The Jews in England: their economic position</h4>—The
first appearance of the Jews in England may practically
be reckoned as occurring at the time of the Norman
Conquest, for immediately after 1066 they came in large
numbers from Rouen, Caen, and other Norman towns.
They stood in the peculiar position of being the personal
property, or “chattels,” of the king, and a special officer
governed their settlements in various towns. These settlements
were called Jewries, of which those at London,
Lincoln, Bury St Edmund’s, and Oxford were at one
time fairly considerable. They were protected by the
king, and of course paid him for their protection. Their
general financial skill was acknowledged by all, and
William II. employed them to farm the revenues of vacant
sees, while barons often employed them as stewards of
their estates. They were also the leading if not the only
capitalists of that time, and must have assisted merchants
considerably in their enterprises, of course upon the
usual commission. After the death of Henry I. the
security which they had enjoyed was much weakened, in
proportion as the royal power declined in the civil wars,
and in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries they were in a
precarious position. Stephen and Matilda openly robbed
them; Henry II. (in 1187) demanded one-fourth of their
chattels, and Richard I. obtained large sums from them
for his crusading extravagances. From 1144 to 1189,
riots directed against them became common, and the
Jewries of many towns were pillaged. In 1194 Richard I.
placed their commercial transactions more thoroughly
under local officers of the crown. John exploited them
to great advantage, and levied heavy tallages upon them,
and Henry III. did very much the
same. They were <span id="p036" class="xxpn">{36}</span>
expelled from the kingdom in 1290, and before this had
greatly sunk from their previous position as the financiers
of the crown, to that of petty money-lenders to the poor
at gross usury. What concerns us more immediately
to notice in this early period of English history, is their
temporary usefulness as capitalists in trading transactions,
at a time when capital was not easily accumulated
or kept in safety.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn17" id="fnanc17">17</a></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
Manufactures in this period: Flemish weavers</h4>—We
now turn from the subject of trade and finance to that
of manufacturing industry. On doing so, we find that
the chief industry is that of weaving coarse woollen cloth.
An industry so necessary as this, and one too that can be
carried on in a simple state of society with such ease, as a
domestic manufacture, would naturally always exist, even
from the most uncivilized times. This had been the case
in England. But it is noticeable that although Henry of
Huntingdon mentions the export of “fine wool” as one
of the chief English exports, and although England had
always been in a specially favourable position for growing
wool, her manufacture of it had not developed to any
great extent. Nevertheless it was practised as a domestic
industry in every rural and urban community, and at
this period already had its gilds—a sure sign of growth.
Indeed one of the oldest <i>craft</i> gilds was that of the London
weavers, of which we find mention in the time of Henry I.
(<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1100). And in this reign, too, we first hear of the
arrival of Flemish immigrants in this country, who helped
largely both then and subsequently in the development
of the woollen manufacture. Some Flemings had come
over indeed in the days of William the Norman, having
been driven from Flanders by an incursion of the sea,
and had settled at Carlisle. But Henry I.,
as we read in <span id="p037" class="xxpn">{37}</span>
Higden’s Chronicle, transferred them to Pembrokeshire
in <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1111: “Flandrenses, tempore regis Henrici
primi, ad occidentalem Walliæ partem, apud Haverford,
sunt translati.” Traces of them remained till a comparatively
recent period, and the names of the village of
<i>Flemingston</i>, and of the road called the <i>Via Flandrica</i>,
running over the crest of the Precelly mountains, afford
striking evidence of their settlement there, as also does
the name <i>Tucking Mill</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Cloth-making mill, from
German and Flemish <i>tuch</i>, “a cloth”). Norfolk also
had from early times been the seat of the woollen industry,
and had had similar influxes of Flemish weavers.
They do not, however, become important till the reign
of Edward III., when we shall find that English cloth
manufacture begins to develop considerably. In this
period, all we can say is that England was more famed
for the wool that it grew than for the cloth which it
manufactured therefrom, and it had yet to learn most of
its improvements from lessons taught by foreigners.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Economic appearance of England in this Period.
Population</h4>—The England of the Domesday Book was
very different from anything which we can now conceive,
nor did its industrial condition change much during the
next century or two. The population was probably
under 2,000,000 in all; for in Domesday Book only
283,342 able-bodied men are enumerated. These multiplied
by five, to include women and children, give
1,400,000 of general population, and allowing for omissions
we shall find two millions rather over than under
the mark. Nor indeed could the agricultural and
industrial state of the country have supported more.
This population was chiefly located in the Southern and
Eastern counties, for the North of England, and especially
Yorkshire, had been laid waste by
the Conqueror, in <span id="p038" class="xxpn">{38}</span>
consequence of its revolt in 1068. The whole country
between York and the Tees was ravaged, and the famine
which ensued is said to have carried off 100,000 victims.
Indeed, for half-a-century the land “lay bare of cultivation
and of men” for sixty miles northward of York, and
for centuries more never fully recovered from this terrible
visitation. The Domesday Book records district after
district, and manor after manor, in Yorkshire as “waste.”
In the East and North-west of England, now the most
densely populated parts of the country, all was fen,
moorland, and forest, peopled only by wild animals and
lawless men. Till the seventeenth century, in fact,
Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire were the
poorest counties in England. The fens of East Anglia
were reclaimed only in 1634. The main ports were
London for general trade; Southampton, for the French
trade in wines; Norwich for the export wool trade with
Flanders, and for imports from the Baltic; and on the
west coast Bristol, which had always been the centre for
the western trade in Severn salmon and hides. At one
time, too, it was the great port for the trade of English
slaves who were taken to Ireland, but William the Norman
checked that traffic, though it lingered till Henry II.
conquered Ireland. For internal trade <i>market towns</i>,
or villages as we should call them, were gradually springing
up. They were nearly always held in demesne by
the lord of the manor, who claimed the tolls, though in
after years the town bought them of him. Some of
these markets had existed from Saxon times, as is seen
by the prefix “Chipping” (=<i>chepinge</i>, A.S. a market),
as in Chipping Norton, Chippingham, and Chepstowe;
others date from a later period, and are known by the
prefix “Market,” as <i>e.g.</i> Market Bosworth. But these
market towns were very small, and
indeed only some <span id="p039" class="xxpn">{39}</span>
half-dozen towns in the kingdom had a population
above 5000 inhabitants. These were London, York,
Bristol, Coventry, Norwich, and Lincoln.</div>

General condition of the Period</h4>—Speaking generally
for the whole period after the Conquest, we may say
that, though the economic condition of England was by
no means unprosperous, industrial development was
necessarily slow. The disputes between Stephen and
Maud, and the civil wars of their partisans, the enormous
drain upon the resources of the country caused by
Richard I.’s expenses in carrying on Crusades when he
should have been ruling his kingdom, and the equally
enormous taxes and bribes paid by the worthless John
to the Papal See, could not fail seriously to check national
industry. It is no wonder that in John’s reign, at the
beginning of the thirteenth century, we hear of great
discontent throughout all the land, of much misery and
poverty, especially in the towns, and of a general feeling
of revolt. That miserable monarch was only saved from
deposition by his opportune death.</div>

<p>Yet with all these evils the economic condition of
England, although depressed, was by no means absolutely
unhealthy; and the following reign (Henry III., 1216–1272),
with its comparative peace and leisure, afforded,
as we shall see, sufficient opportunity to enable the people
to regain a position of general opulence and prosperity.
This time of quiet progress and industrial growth forms
a fitting occasion for the marking out of
a new epoch.</p>

Introductory. Rise of a wage-earning class</h4>—The
long reign of Henry III., although occasionally
troubled by internal dissensions among the barons, was
upon the whole a prosperous and peaceful time for the
people in general, and more especially for those whom
historians are pleased to call the lower classes. For by
this time a remarkable change had begun to affect the
condition of the serfs or villeins, a change already alluded
to before, by which the villeins became free tenants,
subject to a fixed rent for their holdings. This rent was
rapidly becoming a payment in money and not in labour,
for, as we saw, the lords of the manors were frequently
in want of cash, and were ready to sell many of their
privileges. The change was at first gradual, but by the
time of the Great Plague (1348), money rents were becoming
the rule rather than the exception; and though
labour rents were not quite obsolete, it was an ill-advised
attempt to extort them again that was the prime cause
of Wat Tyler’s insurrection (1381). Before the Plague,
in fact, villeinage in the old sense
had become almost <span id="p041" class="xxpn">{41}</span>
extinct, and the peasants, both great and small, had
achieved practical freedom. The richer villeins had developed
into small farmers; while the poorer villeins, and
especially the cottars, had formed a separate class of
agricultural labourers, not indeed entirely without land,
but depending for their livelihood upon wages paid for
helping to cultivate the land of others. The rise of this
class, that lived by wages and not by tilling their own
land, was due to the fact that cottars and others, not
having enough land of their own to occupy their whole
time, were free to hire themselves to those who had a
larger quantity of land. Especially would they become
labourers at a fixed wage for the lord of a manor when he
had commuted his rights to the unpaid services of all his
tenants for a fixed money rent. Of course this change
came gradually, but its effect is seen subsequently in the
difficulties as to wages expressed in the Statute of
Labourers, difficulties which first became serious after
the Great Plague.</div></div><!--chapter-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Agriculture the chief occupation of the people</h4>—Throughout
the whole of this period the vast majority of
the population were continuously engaged in agricultural
pursuits, and this was rendered necessary owing to the
very low rate of production consequent upon the primitive
methods of agriculture. The production of corn was
only about four, or sometimes eight, bushels per acre, and
this naturally had the effect of keeping down the population,
at this time still only between 1,500,000 and
2,000,000. It is a remarkable fact that even the inhabitants
of the towns used at harvest-time to go out
into the country to get agricultural work, and people
often migrated from one district to another for the same
purpose, just as Irish agricultural labourers of to-day are
accustomed to cross over to England for the harvesting. <span id="p042" class="xxpn">{42}</span>
Some attention was being paid to sheep farming, and a
noticeable increase in this branch of industry took place
in the beginning of the fourteenth century. One order
of monks in particular, the Cistercians, used to grow
large quantities of wool; and indeed England had almost
a monopoly in the wool trade with Flanders, for even
Spanish wool could not be utilized without an admixture
of English. But the great increase of sheep farming
occurs rather later, at the beginning of the sixteenth
century.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Methods of cultivation. The capitalist landlord
and his bailiff. The “stock and land” lease</h4>—The
agriculture of the early part of this period is described
to us by Walter de Henley, who wrote a book on husbandry
some time before 1250. It cannot be said that
our agriculture was at this time at a high level, for, as
we have seen, the production of wheat (<i>e.g.</i>) was exceedingly
low, not being more than four to eight bushels per
acre. If we look at a typical manor, we shall find that
the arable lands in it were divided pretty equally between
the landlord and the tenants of the manor; and before
the Great Plague the landlord was not merely a rent-receiving
master, but a capitalist land-owner, who cultivated
his land by means of his bailiff, subject to his
personal supervision. These bailiffs kept very accurate
accounts, and we are thereby greatly helped in our
investigations in this period. The average rent paid by
tenants from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century was
sixpence per acre. In many cases, especially on lands
owned by monasteries, the land was held on the “stock
and land” lease system, by which the landlord let a
certain quantity of stock with the land, for which the
tenant, at the expiration of his lease, had to account
either in money or kind. A relic of this
kind of lease <span id="p043" class="xxpn">{43}</span>
existed even in the eighteenth century, for Arthur
Young occasionally mentions the practice of the landlord
letting cows to dairy farmers. In mediæval times the
person to whom cows were leased for dairy purposes was
the <i>deye</i>—<i>i.e.</i> dairyman or dairymaid. The stock and
land lease plan was favourable to the tenant, for it
supplied his preliminary want of capital, and if he was
fortunate allowed him often to make considerable profits,
and even eventually purchase an estate for himself.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The tenant’s communal land and closes</h4>—It must
always be remembered, however, that the arable land in
a manor was “communal”—<i>i.e.</i> each tenant held a certain
number of furrows or strips in a common field, the separate
divisions being merely marked by a piece of unploughed
land, where the grass was allowed to grow.
The ownership of these several strips was limited to
certain months of the year, generally from Lady Day to
Michaelmas, and for the remainder of the year the land
was common pasture. This simple and rudimentary
system was utterly unsuited to any advanced agriculture.
The tenants, however, also possessed “closes,” some for
corn, others for pasture and hay. The rent of a close
was always higher than that of communal land, being
eightpence instead of sixpence per acre. Besides the
communal arable land, and his close, the husbandman
also had access to two or three kinds of common or
pasture—(1) a common close for oxen, kine, or other
stock, pasture in which is stinted both for landlord and
tenant; (2) the open (“champaign” or “champion”)
country, where the cattle go daily before the herdsmen;
(3) the lord’s out-woods, moors, and heaths, where the
tenants are stinted but the lord is not. Thus the tenant
had valuable pasture rights, besides the land he actually
rented. But the system of holding arable
land in strips <span id="p044" class="xxpn">{44}</span>
was very cumbrous and caused many disputes, since often
a tenant would hold a short lease on one strip and a
longer lease on another; or confusion of ownership
would arise; while in many ways tenure was made
insecure, and no encouragement was given to advanced
agriculture.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
Ploughing</h4>—As regards the cultivation of the land,
it was generally ploughed three times a year. Ordinary
ploughing took place in the autumn, the second ploughing
in April, the third at midsummer. The furrows were,
according to Walter de Henley, a foot apart, and the
plough was not to go more than two fingers deep. The
ploughing and much other work was done by oxen, as
being cheaper than horses. The hoeing was undertaken
by women, who also worked at harvest-time in the fields.
In <i>Peres the Plowman’s Crede</i> (about <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1394) we have a
description of a small farmer ploughing while his wife
leads the oxen. “His wife walked by him with a long
goad, in a cutted cote cutted full high” (l. 433).</div>

<p>An average yield of six bushels per acre is what
Walter de Henley thinks necessary to secure profitable
farming.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Stock, Pigs and Poultry</h4>—As to stock, the amount
kept was generally rather large, and the agriculturist of
the thirteenth century was fully alive to the importance
of keeping it; for Walter de Henley advised stocking
land to the full extent it would bear. Oxen, as we saw,
were kept for the plough and draft; but not much stock
was fatted for the table, especially as it could not be kept
in the winter. There was no attempt to improve breeds
of cattle, for the scarcity of winter food (winter roots being
unknown till much later), and the general want of means
for resisting the severities of the winter helped to keep
all breeds much upon the same level. On
the other hand, <span id="p045" class="xxpn">{45}</span>
swine were kept in large numbers, and every peasant had
his pig in his sty, and, indeed, probably lived on salt
pork most of the winter. Care was taken with the
different breeds. The whole of the parish swine were
generally put in summer under the charge of one swineherd,
who was paid both by tenants and the lord of the
manor. The keeping of poultry, too, was at that time
universal, so much so that they were very rarely bought
by anyone, and when sold were almost absurdly cheap.
This habit of keeping fowls, ducks, and geese must have
materially helped the peasant in ekeing out his wages, or
in paying that portion of his rent which was paid in
kind; as <i>e.g.</i> in the case of the Cuxham tenant (p. <a href="#p015" title="go to p. 15">15</a>)
who had to pay his lord six fowls in all during the
year.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
Sheep</h4>—This animal is so important in English
agriculture that we must devote a special paragraph to it
alone. For the sheep was, in the earlier periods of
English industrial history, the mainstay of the British
farmer, chiefly, of course, owing to the quantity of wool
required for export. England had, up to a comparatively
recent period, almost a monopoly of the raw wool
trade, her only rival being Spain. There were, as mentioned
before, a great number of breeds of sheep, and
much care was taken to improve them. The fleece however
was light, being only as an average
<span class="nowrap">1 lb. 7&#x2060;¾ oz.,</span>
according to Professor Rogers, and the animal was small.
The reason of this was that the attempts of the husbandman
to improve his breeds were baffled by the hardships
of the mediæval winter, and by the prevalence of disease,
especially the rot and scab. It is probable that the
average loss on the flocks was 20 per cent. a year. They
were generally kept under cover from November to
April, and fed on coarse hay, wheat,
and oat straw, <span id="p046" class="xxpn">{46}</span>
or pea and vetch haulm; but no winter roots were
available.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
Increase of sheep farming</h4>—A great increase of
sheep farming took place after the Great Plague (1348),
and this from two causes. The rapid increase of woollen
manufactures promoted by Edward III. rendered wool
growing more profitable, while at the same time the
scarcity of labour, occasioned by the ravages of the
Black Death, and the consequently higher wages demanded,
naturally attracted the farmer to an industry
which was at once very profitable, and required but little
paid labour. So, after the Plague, we find a tendency
among large agriculturists to turn ploughed fields into
permanent pasture, or, at any rate, to use the same land
for pasture and for crops, instead of turning portions of
the “waste” into arable land. Consequently from the
beginning of the fifteenth century we notice that the
agricultural population decreases in proportion as sheep
farming increases; and the steady change may be
traced in numerous preventive statutes till we come (in
1536) to those of Henry VIII. about decayed towns,
especially in the Midlands and the Isle of Wight, culminating
in the excitements of 1549. Another cause that, in
Henry VIII.’s time, had a distinct influence in promoting
sheep farming, was the lack of capital that made itself
felt, owing to the general impoverishment of England in
his wasteful reign, and which naturally turned farmers
to an industry that required little capital, but gave quick
returns.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 9.</span>
Consequent increase of enclosures</h4>—One consequence
of this more extensive sheep farming was the great
increase in enclosures made by the landlords in the sixteenth
century. So great were these encroachments and
enclosures in north-east Norfolk, that they
led, in 1549, <span id="p047" class="xxpn">{47}</span>
to a rebellion against the enclosing system, headed by
Ket; but, though more marked, perhaps, in Henry
VIII.’s reign, the practice of sheep farming had been
growing steadily in the previous century. Fortescue, the
Lord Chancellor of Henry VI. (in the middle of the
fifteenth century), refers to its growth and the prosperity
it caused in rural districts—a prosperity, however, that
must have been confined only to the great land-owners.
We receive other confirmation of this from various
statutes designed to prevent the rural population from
flowing into the towns, as, for example, the Acts of 1 and
9 Richard II. (1377 and 1385), of 17 Richard II. (1394),
promoting the export of corn in hopes of making arable
land more valuable. Another Act was passed in 1489
(4 Henry VII.) to keep the rural population from the
towns. But the growth of sheep farming is also connected
with a great economic and industrial development
in England, the rise and progress of cloth manufactures
and of the weaving industry generally, and to
this we must now devote our next chapter.</div>

<div class="section padtopb">
<h3>CHAPTER II
<span class="hsmall">
THE WOOLLEN TRADE AND MANUFACTURES</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
England’s monopoly of wool</h4>—In the Middle Ages
England was the only wool-producing country in the
North of Europe. Spain grew wool also, but it could not
be used alone for every kind of fabric, and besides it was
more difficult to transport wool from Spain to Flanders,
the seat of the manufacture of that article, than it was to
send it across the narrow German Ocean, where swarms
of light craft plied constantly between
Flanders and the <span id="p048" class="xxpn">{48}</span>
eastern ports of England. Hence England had a
practical monopoly of the wool trade, which was due not
only to its favourable climate and soil, but also to the
fact that even at the worst periods of civil war—and they
did not last for long—our island was incomparably more
peaceful than the countries of Western Europe. From
the thirteenth to the seventeenth century, the farmers of
Western Europe could not possibly have kept sheep, the
most defenceless and tender of domestic animals, amid
the wars that were continually devastating their homesteads;
nor, as a matter of fact, did they do so. But in
England, especially after the twelfth century, nearly
everybody in the realm, from the king to the villein, was
concerned in agriculture, and was interested therefore in
maintaining peace. Even when the great landlords,
after the Plague of 1348, gave up the cultivation of their
arable land, they went in, as we saw, for sheep farming,
and enclosed large tracts of land for that purpose. Hence
the export trade in wool became more and more important,
and there was always a continual demand for
English wool to supply the busy looms of the great
manufacturing towns in Flanders.</div>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Wool and Politics</h4>—The most convincing proof
of the importance of the wool trade is seen in England’s
diplomatic relations with Flanders, which, by the way,
afford an interesting example of the necessity of taking
economic factors into account in dealing with national
history. Flanders was the great manufacturing country
of Europe at that time. England supplied its raw
material in vast quantities, and nine-tenths of English
wool went to the looms of Bruges and Ghent. A stoppage
of this export from England used to throw half the
population of the Flemish towns out of work. The
immense transactions that even then
took place, are <span id="p049" class="xxpn">{49}</span>
seen from the fact that a single company of Florentine
merchants would contract with the Cistercian monks of
England for the whole year’s supply of the wool produced
on their vast sheep-ranges on the Yorkshire moorlands;
for the Cistercian order were among the foremost wool-growers
in the country. Now, it is a curious and significant
fact that when Edward I., Edward III., and Henry
V. premeditated an attack on France, they generally
took care to gain the friendship of Flanders first,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn18" id="fnanc18">18</a>
so as
to use that country as a base from which to enter France,
or at least as a useful ally; and secondly, they paid a
large proportion of the expenses of their French expeditions
by means of a wool-tax in England. Thus, when
Edward III. opened his campaign against France in
1340, he did so from Flanders, with special help afforded
by a Flemish alliance. This king also received annually
£60,000 from the wool-tax alone, and on special occasions
even more. Again, it was a grant of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> on each sack
of wool exported that enabled Edward I. in 1275 to fill
his treasury for his subsequent invasion of Wales. The
same king in 1297 got the means for equipping an
expedition against France, <i>via</i> Flanders, in the same way.
Similarly Henry V. took care to cultivate the friendship
of the Flemish and their rulers before setting out to gain
the French crown, and paid for his expedition by raising
taxes on wool and hides. The enormous revenues also
which from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century were
exacted from England by the Papal Court, and by the
Italian ecclesiastics quartered on English benefices, were
transmitted in the shape of wool to Flanders, and sold
by the Lombard exchangers, who transmitted the
money thus realized to Italy. The extent of these
revenues may be gathered from the
fact that the <span id="p050" class="xxpn">{50}</span>
Parliament of 1343, in a petition against Papal appointments
to English ecclesiastical vacancies, asserted that—“The
Pope’s revenue from England alone is larger than that
of any Prince in Christendom.” And at this very time
the deaneries of Lichfield, Salisbury, and York, and the
archdeaconry of Canterbury, were all held by Italian
dignitaries, while the Pope’s collector sent from London
20,000 marks a year to his master at Rome. Now, these
impositions were paid out of the proceeds of English
wool. It is interesting, too, to find that taxes for King
Edward III. were calculated, not in money, but in sacks
of wool. In one year the Parliament granted him 20,000
sacks; in another year 30,000 sacks. In 1339 the barons
granted him “the tenth sheep, fleece, and lamb.” Early
in the fifteenth century £30,000 out of the £40,000 revenue
from customs and taxes came from wool alone. Once
more, as in the days of the Crusades, we are able to see
how the Hundred Years’ War with France, and the
exactions of Rome, were paid for by the industrial
portion of the community, while underneath the glamour
of the victories of Edward III. and Henry V. lies the
prosaic but powerful wool-sack.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn19" id="fnanc19">19</a></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Prices and brands of English wool</h4>—Having now
seen the importance of wool as a factor in English industry
and political history, we must proceed to study
more closely the facts of the woollen trade, and the
manufacture of woollen cloth. The chief growers of
wool were the Cistercian monks, who owned huge flocks
of sheep. The wool grown near Leominster, in Herefordshire,
was the finest of all, and, generally speaking,
that grown in Wiltshire, Essex, Sussex, Hampshire, Oxfordshire,
Cambridge and Warwickshire, was the best.
The poorest came from the North of
England, and from <span id="p051" class="xxpn">{51}</span>
the Southern downs. There were a number of different
breeds of sheep, for care was taken to improve the breed,
and it would seem that forty-four different brands of
English wool, ranging in value from £13 to £2, 10<i>s.</i> the
sack (of 364 lbs.), were recognized both in the home and
foreign markets, as mentioned in a Parliamentary petition
of 1454. The average price of wool from 1260–1400
was <span class="nowrap">2<i>s.</i> 1&#x2060;¾<i>d.</i></span>
per clove of 7 lbs.—<i>i.e.</i> a little over threepence
a pound, sometimes fourpence. In the middle of
this period (1350) the average annual export, according
to Misselden, in the <i>Circle of Commerce</i>, was about
11,648,000 lbs., representing a value of some £180,683
yearly.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
English manufactures</h4>—Now, although I have
spoken of Flanders as the manufacturing centre for
Europe, it must not be supposed that England could not
manufacture any of the large quantity of wool which it
grew. Undoubtedly the people of the Netherlands were
at that time the great manufacturers of the world, and
were acquainted with arts and processes to which the
English were strangers, while for a long time the English
could not weave fine cloths; but, nevertheless, there was
a considerable manufacturing industry, chiefly of coarse
cloths, an industry very widely spread, and carried on in
people’s own cottages under the domestic system. The
chief kinds of cloth made were hempen, linen, and woollen
coverings, such as would be used for sacks, dairy-cloths,
woolpacks, sails of windmills, and similar purposes. The
great textile centres were Norfolk and Suffolk, where,
indeed, manufacturing industries had existed long before
the earliest records. An idea of their importance may
be given from the fact that, in the assessment for the
wool-tax of 1341, Norfolk was counted by far the wealthiest
county in England after
Middlesex (including London). <span id="p052" class="xxpn">{52}</span>
There was also a cloth industry of importance in the West
of England, the chief centres being Westbury, Sherborne,
and Salisbury. The linen of Aylsham was also celebrated.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
Foreign manufacture of fine goods</h4>—But we find
rich people used to purchase fine cloths from abroad—<i>e.g.</i>
linen from Liège and Flanders generally, and velvet and
silk goods from Genoa and Venice—although there was
certainly a silk industry in London, carried on chiefly by
women, and protected by an Act of 1454. In the England
of which we are now speaking, the textile industries
were prevented from attaining a full development from
the fact that, though general, they were strictly local;
and, moreover, those who practised them did not look
upon their handicraft as their sole means of livelihood,
but even till the eighteenth century were generally engaged
in agriculture as well. The cause of this is connected
with the isolation and self-sufficiency of separate
communities, previously noted. An evidence of the consequent
inferiority of English to Flemish cloth is given by
the fact that an Act of 1261 attempts to prohibit the import
of spun stuff and the export of wool. Needless to
say it was useless. The prices of cloth at this period are
interesting, as showing the great difference between the
fine (<i>i.e.</i> foreign) and coarse (home) cloths. The average
price of linen is 4<i>d.</i> an ell, being as low as 2<i>d.</i> and as
high as 8&#x2060;¼<i>d.</i> Inferior woollens sold at
<span class="nowrap">1<i>s.</i> 7&#x2060;½<i>d.</i></span> a yard,
“russet” at
<span class="nowrap">1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>,</span> blanketing at 1<i>s.</i> On the other
hand, scarlet cloth (foreign) rises to the enormous price
of 15<i>s.</i> a yard. Cloth for liveries varied from 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>
to 1<i>s.</i> per yard. Speaking generally for the period
1260–1400, we may give the average price of the best
quality at
<span class="nowrap">3<i>s.</i> 3&#x2060;½<i>d.</i></span> a yard from 1260–1350, and 3<i>s.</i> 5&#x2060;½<i>d.</i>
from 1350–1400; while cloth of
the second quality <span id="p053" class="xxpn">{53}</span>
fetched <span class="nowrap">1<i>s.</i> 4&#x2060;½<i>d.</i></span>
in the first period, and 1<i>s.</i> 11&#x2060;¼<i>d.</i> in the
second.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Flemish settlers teach the English weavers. Norwich</h4>—It
is to Edward III., very largely, that the development
of English textile industry is due. It is true
that, long before, Henry II. had endeavoured to stimulate
English manufacture by establishing a “cloth fair” in
the churchyard of St Bartholomew. But English industry
had developed slowly till the days of Edward,
partly, no doubt, owing to the continual disorder of the
preceding reigns. Stimulated, probably, by his wife
Philippa’s connexion with Flanders, he encouraged
Flemish weavers to settle in England, chiefly in the
Eastern counties, though we hear of two Flemings from
Brabant settling in York in 1331; and about this time
one John Kemp, also a Fleming, removed from Norwich,
and founded in Westmoreland the manufacture of the
famous “Kendal green.” The chief centre, however, of
the foreign weavers was naturally Norwich, the Manchester
of those days, with a population of some 6000, and
the chief industry was that of worsted cloths, so named
from the place of manufacture, Worstead. When we
speak of worsted cloths, we mean those plain, unpretending
fabrics that probably never went beyond a plain
weave or a four-shaft twill. The yarn was very largely
spun on the rock or distaff, by means of a primitive whorl
or spindle, while the loom was but a small improvement
on that in which Penelope wove her famous web. There
was a great demand among religious orders for sayes and
the like, of good quality; plain worsteds were generally
worn by the public.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
The worsted industry</h4>—Whether the growth of the
worsted cloth industry was connected or not with this
particular Flemish immigration
we cannot determine. <span id="p054" class="xxpn">{54}</span>
The manufacture was confirmed to the town of Worstead
by a patent of 1313, and in 1328, also, Edward III. issued
a letter patent on behalf of the cloth workers in worsted
in the county of Norfolk. The manufacture was already
so extensive and important that the next year a special
“aulnager” (or cloth searcher) was appointed to inspect
the worsted stuffs of Norwich and district, and held his
office for twenty years. In 1348, however, on the petition
of the worsted weavers and merchants themselves, the
patent was revoked, and the aulnager removed. But in
1410, when Norwich gained a new charter, the power of
“aulnage” was once more given, at its own request,
to its mayor and sheriffs, or their deputies.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
Gilds in the cloth trade</h4>—In the previous period we
referred to the origin and growth of the craft gilds, and it
is interesting to note their importance in connexion with
the woollen industry at this time. As a separate craft,
that of the weaver cannot be traced back beyond the
early part of the twelfth century; in the middle of the
twelfth century, however, gilds of weavers are found established
in several of the larger English towns. At first
they were in voluntary association, though acting independently
of each other, but it became the policy of the
government in the fourteenth century to extend the gild
organization over the whole country, and thus to bring
craftsmen together in organized bodies. Elaborate
regulations were drawn up for their governance by
Parliament, or by municipalities. Now, in London at
this date (1300), and probably at Norwich and other
large towns, the woollen industry was divided into four
or five branches, the weavers and burellers, the dyers
and fullers, and the tailors (<i>cissores</i>). The weavers and
burellers were united in the same gild, the dyers and
fullers in another, while the tailors formed a
third gild of <span id="p055" class="xxpn">{55}</span>
their own. But they were all very conscious that they
had interests in common, and they were accustomed to
act together in matters affecting the industry as a whole,
such as, <i>e.g.</i>, ordering cloth made in the city to be dyed
and fulled in that city, and not sent out to some other
town.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 9.</span>
The dyeing of cloth</h4>—The dyeing and fulling industry,
however, could not have flourished much in England
at this time, for English cloths were mostly sent to
be fulled and dyed in the Netherlands; and indeed we
cannot consider dyeing as a really English industry till
the days of James I., where it will be duly mentioned. At
the same time it was not unknown, for we have scarlet,
russet, and black cloths of English make in the fourteenth
century. But the industry was chiefly carried on in the
Netherlands, owing to the progress there made in the
cultivation of madder, which forms the basis of so many
different dyes. This plant has never been at any time
largely cultivated in England, and, moreover, the Dutch
for several centuries possessed the sole secret of a process
of pulverizing the root in order to prepare it for use. Such
being the case, there is no wonder that they far excelled
the English in the art of dyeing.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 10.</span>
The great transition in English industry</h4>—From
the time of this first Flemish immigration in the fourteenth
century, we perceive the beginning of an important
modification in our home industries. Hitherto England
had been almost exclusively a purely agricultural country,
growing large quantities of wool, exporting it as raw
material, and importing manufactured goods in exchange.
But from this period the export of wool gradually declines,
while on the other hand our home manufactures
increase, until at length they in turn are exported. In
fact, manufactured cloth, and not raw
wool, becomes the <span id="p056" class="xxpn">{56}</span>
basis of our national wealth, and finally the export is
forbidden altogether, so that we may have the more for
the looms at home.</div>

<p>A proof of the growing importance of manufacture in
this period is the noticeable lack of labourers and the
high wages they get, as set forth in the Act 7 Henry IV.
(<i>i.e.</i> 1406), which points to an increase of weavers in all
parts of the kingdom, that takes labourers from other
employments.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 11.</span>
The manufacturing class and politics</h4>—The growing
importance of the manufacturing class which was now
rapidly springing up, can be clearly traced in the politics
of the Tudor period. In spite of two great drawbacks the
cloth manufacture was growing. It had naturally been
severely checked for a generation or so by the awful
national disaster of the Great Plague, which occurred so
soon after Edward II. had helped to found it in England,
and which for the time utterly paralysed English industry
in all its branches. It had been checked again by
the long and useless wars which Edward III. and his
successors carried on against France, at enormous cost
and with no practical results, but which of course were
paid for out of the proceeds of our national industries.
But after these two checks it developed steadily, even
during the Wars of the Roses; for these wars were carried
on almost exclusively by the barons and their retainers,
in a series of battles hardly any of which were of any
magnitude, exaggerated though they have been both by
contemporary and later historians. These wars had the
ultimate effect of causing the feudal aristocracy to destroy
itself in a suicidal conflict, and thus helped to increase the
influence of the middle class—<i>i.e.</i> the merchants and manufacturers—as
a factor in political life. And thus it became
the policy of the Tudor sovereigns, who were
gifted with a <span id="p057" class="xxpn">{57}</span>
certain amount of native shrewdness, to hasten the decaying
power of the feudal lords by simultaneously supporting,
and being supported by, the middle class, and to the
alliance thus made between the crown and the industrial
portion of the community we owe a rapid increase of the
commercial prosperity which laid the foundations of the
greatness of the Elizabethan age, and of the great mercantile
enterprises that succeeded it.</div>

THE TOWNS, INDUSTRIAL VILLAGES, AND FAIRS</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
The chief manufacturing towns</h4>—During the period
between the Norman Conquest and the middle of the
thirteenth century, the towns, as we saw, had been gradually
growing in importance, gaining fresh privileges, and
becoming almost, in some cases quite, independent of the
lord or king, by the grant of a charter. Moreover they
had grown from the mere trading centres of ancient times
into seats of specialized industries, regulated and organized
by the craft gilds. This new feature of the industrial
or manufacturing aspect of certain towns is well shown in
a compilation, dated about 1250, and quoted by Professor
Rogers in <i>Six Centuries of Work and Wages</i>, which gives a
list of English towns and their chief products. Hardly
any of the manufacturing towns mentioned are in the
North of England, but mostly in the
East and South. <span id="p058" class="xxpn">{58}</span></div>

<p>This list is obviously incomplete, for it omits towns like Sheffield
and Winchester, both of which were important as manufacturing towns
from very early times, though the woollen manufactures of the latter
were soon outstripped by those of Hull, York, Beverley, Lincoln, and
especially Norwich. But such as it is the list is curious, chiefly
as showing how manufactures have long since deserted their original
abodes, and have been transferred to towns of quite recent origin.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Staple towns and the merchants</h4>—It
will have been <span id="p059" class="xxpn">{59}</span>
observed that by the time this list was compiled, most
towns were either the seat of a certain manufacture, or the
market where such manufactures were sold. Now, in the
days of Edward I. and Edward II. (1272–1327), several
such towns were specially singled out and granted the
privilege of selling a particular product, the <i>staple</i> of the
district, and were hence called <i>staple towns</i>. Besides a
number of towns in England, staples were fixed at certain
foreign ports for the sale of English goods. At first Antwerp
was selected as the staple town for our produce, and
afterwards St Omer. A staple was also set up at Calais
when we took it (1347), but at the loss of that town in
1558 it was transferred to Bruges. The staple system
thus begun by the first two Edwards, was established upon
a firm legal basis by Edward III. The statute 27 Edward
III. c. 9 (1354), enumerates all the staple towns of
England, and sets forth the ancient customs payable upon
staple goods. It enacts that only merchants of a particular
staple—<i>i.e.</i> those engaged in a particular trade like
wool or hides—may export these goods, and that each
staple should be governed by its own mayor and constables.
Now, although regulations like these are opposed
to our modern ideas of free competition, they were
to a certain extent useful in the Middle Ages, because the
existence of staple towns facilitated the collection of
custom duties, and also secured in some degree the good
quality of the goods made in, or exported from, a town.
For special officers were appointed to mark them if of the
proper quality and reject them if inferior. The system
also had the important <i>political</i> result of bringing into
prominence the merchants as a class, and of increasing
their influence. So much were they a special class, that
the sovereign always negotiated with them separately.
Thus in 1339, when Edward III. was
as usual fighting <span id="p060" class="xxpn">{60}</span>
against France, and, also as usual, in great want of
money, he was liberally supplied with loans by Sir
William de la Pole, a rich merchant of Hull, who acted
on behalf of himself, and many other merchants. Sir
Richard Whittington performed similar services for
Henry IV. and Henry V.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Markets</h4>—Another class of towns were the country
market towns, many of which exist in agricultural districts
to-day, in much the same fashion as they did six
centuries ago. The control and regulation of the town
market was at first in the hands of the lord of the manor,
but by this period it had been bought by the corporation
or by the merchant gild, or by both, and was now one of
the most valued of municipal privileges. The market-place
was always some large open space within the city
walls, such as, for instance, exists very noticeably in
Nottingham to this day. London had several such
spaces, of which the names Cornhill, Cheapside, the
Poultry, still remain. The capital was indeed a perpetual
market, though of course provincial towns only
held a market on one or two days of the week. It is
curious to notice how these days have persisted to
modern times. The Wednesday and Saturday market of
Oxford has existed for at least six centuries, if not more.
The control of these markets was undertaken by the corporation
for various purposes. The first of these was to
prevent frauds and adulteration of goods, and for this
purpose special officers were appointed, as in the staple
towns, or like the “aulnager” of Norwich mentioned
before (p. <a href="#p054" title="go to p. 54">54</a>). This was possible in a time when industry
was limited, and the competitive idea was as yet unborn,
and one cannot help thinking that it must have been of
great use to purchasers. The second object of the
regulators of the market was to keep prices
at a “natural <span id="p061" class="xxpn">{61}</span>
level,” and to regulate the cost of manufactured articles.
The price of provisions in especial was a subject of much
regulation, but our forefathers were not very successful in
this point, laudable though their object
was.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn20" id="fnanc20">20</a></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The great fairs</h4>—Now, besides the weekly markets
there were held annually in various parts of the kingdom
large fairs, which often lasted many days, and which form
a most important and interesting economic feature of the
time. They were necessary for two reasons: (1) because
the ordinary trader could not and did not exist in the
small villages, in which it must be remembered most of the
population lived, nor could he even find sufficient customers
in a town of that time, for very few contained over
5000 inhabitants; (2) because the inhabitants of the
villages and towns could find in the fairs a wider market
for their goods, and more variety for their purchases.
The result was that these fairs were frequented by all
classes of the population, from noble and prelate to the
villein, and hardly a family in England did not at one
time of the year or another send a representative, or at
least give a commission to a friend, to get goods at some
celebrated fair. They afforded an opportunity for commercial
intercourse between inhabitants of all parts of
England, and with traders from all parts of Europe.
They were, moreover, a necessity arising from the
economic conditions of a time when transit of goods was
comparatively slow, and when ordinary people disliked
travelling frequently or far beyond the limits of their own
district. The spirit of isolation which is so marked a
feature of the mediæval town or village encouraged this
feeling, and except the trading class few people travelled
about, and those who did so were regarded with suspicion.
Till the epoch of modern railways, in
fact, fairs were a <span id="p062" class="xxpn">{62}</span>
necessity, though now the rapidity of locomotion and the
facility with which goods can be ordered and despatched,
have annihilated their utility and rendered their relics a
nuisance. But even in the present day there are plenty
of people to be found in rural districts who have rarely,
and sometimes never, been a dozen miles from their
native village.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
The fairs of Winchester and Stourbridge</h4>—Fairs
were held in every part of the country at various parts
of the year. Thus there was a fair at Leeds, which for
several centuries served as a centre where the wool-growers
of Yorkshire and Lancashire met English and
foreign merchants from Hull and other eastern ports, and
sold them the raw material that was to be worked up in
the looms of Flanders. But there were a few great fairs
that eclipsed all others in magnitude and importance, and
of these two deserve special mention, those at Winchester
and Stourbridge. (1) That at <i>Winchester</i> was founded in
the reign of William the Norman, who granted the Bishop
of Winchester leave to hold a fair on St Giles’ Hill, for one
day in the year. Henry II., however, granted a charter
for a fair of sixteen days. During this time the great
common was covered with booths and tents, and divided
into streets called after the name of the goods sold
therein, as, <i>e.g.</i>, “The Drapery,” “The Pottery,” “The
Spicery.” Tolls were levied on every bridge and roadway
to the fair, and brought in a large revenue. The fair
was of importance till the fourteenth century, for in the
<i>Vision of Peres the Plowman</i>, Covetousness tells how</div>

<div>
“To Wye and to Winchester I went to the fair.”
</div>

<p class="pcontinue">But it declined from the time of Edward III., chiefly
owing to the fact that the woollen trade
of Norwich and <span id="p063" class="xxpn">{63}</span>
other eastern towns had become far more important,
while on the other hand Southampton was found to be
a more convenient spot for the Venetian traders’ fleet
(p. <a href="#p093" title="go to p. 93">93</a>) to do business.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Stourbridge Fair</i>—But the greatest of all English
fairs, and that which kept its reputation and importance
the longest, was the Fair of Stourbridge, near
Cambridge.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn21" id="fnanc21">21</a>
It was of European renown, and lasted for a
whole month, from the end of August to the end of September.
Its importance was due to the fact that it was
within easy reach of the ports of the east coast, which at
that time were very accessible and much frequented.
Hither came the Venetian, and Genoese merchants, with
stores of Eastern produce—silks and velvets, cotton, and
precious stones. The Flemish merchants brought the
fine linens and cloths of Bruges, Liège, and Ghent, and
other manufacturing towns. Frenchmen and Spaniards
were present with their wines; Norwegian sailors with
tar and pitch; and the mighty traders of the Hanse
towns exposed to sale furs and amber for the rich, iron and
copper for the farmers, flax for their wives; while homely
fustian, buckram, wax, herrings, and canvas mingled incongruously
in their booths with strange, far-off Eastern
spices and ornaments. And in return the English
farmers—or traders on their behalf—carried to the fair
hundreds of huge wool-sacks, wherewith to clothe the
nations of Europe; or barley for the Flemish breweries,
with corn and horses and cattle also. Lead was brought
from the mines of Derbyshire, and tin from Cornwall;
even some iron from Sussex, but this was accounted inferior
to the imported metal. All these wares were, as at
Winchester, exposed in stalls and tents in long streets,
some named after the various
nations that congregated <span id="p064" class="xxpn">{64}</span>
there, and others after the kind of goods on sale. This
vast fair lasted down to the eighteenth century in unabated
vigour, and was at that time described by Daniel
Defoe, in a work now easily accessible to all,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn22" id="fnanc22">22</a>
which contains
a most interesting description of all the proceedings
of this busy month. It is not much more than a hundred
years since the Lancashire merchants alone used to
send their goods to Stourbridge, upon a thousand pack-horses,
but now the pack-horses and fairs have gone, and
the telegraph and railway have taken their place.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
English mediæval ports</h4>—In the last paragraph
mention was made of the east coast having ports of great
prominence in this period. It will be convenient here
to notice what were the chief ports of England, and to
remark how few of them have retained their old importance.
The chief port was of course London, which has
always held an exceptional position, and the other principal
ports were on the east and south coast. Southampton
was from early times the chief southern harbour, and
next to it Dartmouth, Plymouth, Sandwich, and Winchelsea,
Weymouth, Shoreham, Dover, and Margate.
They were connected with the trade in French and
Spanish goods. On the western coast Bristol was almost
the only port much frequented, and was the centre and
harbour for the western fisheries, and also a place of export
for hides and the cloth manufactures of the western
towns. In the fifteenth century Bristol fishermen penetrated
through the Hebrides to the Shetland and Orkney
Islands and the northern fisheries, where they found that
the Scarborough men had long preceded them. On the
eastern coast, indeed, Scarborough was one of the most
enterprising ports. Boston, Hull,
Lynn, Harwich, <span id="p065" class="xxpn">{65}</span>
Yarmouth, and Colchester were also very flourishing, and
were concerned in the Flemish and Baltic trade. Farther
north Newcastle was the centre for the coasting trade in
coal, and Berwick was a fisherman’s harbour. But the
southern and eastern ports were the most frequented, as
being suitable to the light and shallow craft that did a
coasting trade, or ran across to the Continent in smooth
weather.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
The temporary decay of manufacturing towns</h4>—We
have now noticed the chief markets, fairs, ports, and
manufacturing towns of mediæval England, and it will be
seen that commercial prosperity was certainly developing.
So too were home manufacturing industries, but
their growth brought about a curious effect in the decay
of certain towns, and the rise of industrial villages in
rural districts. To the decay of towns we find frequent
reference in the Statutes of Henry VII. and his successor—<i>i.e.</i>
from 1490 or 1500 onwards. This decay was due
to two causes: (1) to the growth of sheep farming, mentioned
above (p. <a href="#p045" title="go to p. 45">45</a>), and (2) to the fact that the industrial
disabilities imposed upon dwellers in towns, in consequence
of the corporate privileges of the gilds, now far
exceeded the advantages of residence there. The days
of usefulness for the gilds had gone past; their restrictions
were now only felt to cramp the rising manufacturing
industries. Hence we find the manufacturers
of the Tudor period were leaving the towns and seeking
open villages instead, where they could develop their
trade free from the vexatious restrictions of old-fashioned
corporations. Of course laws were passed to check this
tendency, and to confine particular industries to particular
towns. Thus, in Norfolk, no one was to “dye,
shear, or calendar cloth” anywhere but in the town of
Norwich (Act of 14 and 15 Henry VIII.); no
one in the <span id="p066" class="xxpn">{66}</span>
northern counties was to make “worsted coverlets”
except in York (Act of 33 and 34 Henry VIII.).</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
Growth of industrial villages. The germs of the
modern factory system</h4>—Such protective enactments
were, however, as protective enactments must generally
be, utterly in vain. Henry VII. tried to remedy the supposed
evil by limiting the privileges of interference of
the gilds, but even this step was useless. Manufactures
were slowly and surely transferred to various villages,
and in several industries a kind of modern factory system
can be traced at this time. Master manufacturers,
weary of municipal and gild-made restrictions, organized
in country places little communities solely for industrial
purposes, and so arranged as to afford greater scope for
the combination and division of labour. The system of
apprenticeship was a powerful element in this scheme,
and supplied ready labour for these small factories. The
goods were made not as formerly only for local use, but
for the purposes of trade and profit throughout the
kingdom. The master was bound to his workmen
rather more closely than the mill-owner of the present
day to his “hands,” for the spirit of personal sympathy
and obligation still survived in these small labour communities.
But the germs of the modern system were
there; for this new system was not that of domestic
or cottage industry, as had been the rule in previous
periods, but a system of congregated labour organized
upon a capitalistic basis by one man—the organizer,
head, and owner of the industrial village—the master
clothier. Among the famous master clothiers of the
woollen industry, we read of Cuthbert of Kendal, Hodgkins
of Halifax, Brian of Manchester, each of whom
“kept a great number of servants at work—carders,
spinners, weavers, dyers,
shearers, and others.” <span id="p067" class="xxpn">{67}</span>
Perhaps the greatest of them was John Winchcombe, or
“Jack of Newbury,” as he was called, of whom it is
recorded that a hundred looms always worked in his
house, and he was rich enough to send a hundred of his
journeymen to Flodden Field, in 1513. His kerseys
were famous all over Europe. It was from communities
such as these that the villages of Manchester, Bolton,
Leeds, Halifax, and Bury took their rise, and afterwards
developed into the great factory towns of to-day. But
these workshops, large though they seemed then, were
utterly insignificant compared with the huge factories
of to-day, where the workmen are numbered in thousands,
and are, to the capitalist-employer or joint-stock
company that owns the mill, merely a mass of human
machines, more intelligent though not so durable as
other machines, and possessed of an unpleasant tendency
to go out “on strike,” for reasons that naturally appear
to their employer insufficient and subversive of the whole
industrial system. However, the industrial system is
not subverted, though the workmen can hardly be said
to be upon the same pleasant footing with their employers
as they used to be in the old industrial village.</div>

<h3>CHAPTER IV
<span class="hsmall">
THE GREAT PLAGUE AND ITS ECONOMIC EFFECTS</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
Material progress of the country</h4>—In the preceding
chapters we have attempted to give an idea of the state
of industry and commerce in England in the Middle
Ages. We now come to a most important landmark in
the history of the social and industrial
condition of the <span id="p068" class="xxpn">{68}</span>
people—viz. the Great Plague of 1348 and subsequent
years. Almost two centuries had elapsed since the death
of Stephen (1154), and the cessation of those great civil
conflicts which harried England in his reign. These
two centuries had witnessed on the whole a continuous
growth of material prosperity. The wealth of the country
had increased; the towns had developed and had
aided the growth of a prosperous mercantile and industrial
middle class, who regulated their own affairs in their
gilds, and also had a voice in municipal management.
The country at large was mainly devoted to agricultural
and pastoral pursuits, and the mass of the people were
engaged in tilling the ground or feeding cattle. The
mass of the people too were now better fed and better
clothed than those of a similar class on the Continent,
and a great proof of their general prosperity is to be found
in the nature of their food. It is a significant economic
fact that wheaten bread was then, and has generally since
been, the staple food of the English labourer. In most
other lands, bread made from rye and other cereals was
generally good enough for the working classes. If rye
failed they had nothing to fall back upon, and thus
famines were frequent. But the English labourer always
had some other cereal besides wheat in reserve.</div>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Social changes. The villeins and wage-paid
labourers</h4>—Besides the growth of material prosperity in
these two centuries, we find that the commutation of
villeinage services into money payments to the lord of
the manor—a tendency frequently commented upon—had
been growing apace. This commutation had been
going on for a long time, in fact ever since the Conquest,
if not before, and the villeins in general had freed themselves
not only from labour-dues, but from the vexatious
customary fines or “amercements” which
they had to <span id="p069" class="xxpn">{69}</span>
pay to the lord of the manor on certain social occasions—such
as the marriage of a daughter, or the education of a
son for the Church. But of course this freedom was not
complete, though it is important to notice its growth,
for we shall see that it formed the occasion of a great
class struggle some years after the Great Plague.</div>

<p>There is another feature which is also of importance,
and which had come more and more into prominence
during the past two centuries. I refer to the increase in
the numbers of those who lived upon the labour of their
hands, and were employed and paid wages like labourers
of the present day. It has been mentioned before that
they arose from the cottar class, who had not enough
land to occupy their whole time, and who were therefore
ready to sell their labour to an employer. These two
features, the commutation of labour-dues for money
payments, and the rise of a wage-paid labouring class, are
closely connected, for it was natural that, when the lord
of a manor had agreed to receive money from his tenants
in villeinage instead of labour, he should have to obtain
other labour from elsewhere and pay for it in the money
thus received by commutation. The tendency of these
social changes was greatly in favour of the villeins, whose
social condition had steadily improved, and whose
tenancy in villeinage was more and more becoming a
“free” tenancy. Neither were the villeins, whether
comparatively well-to-do yeomen or agricultural
labourers, so much bound to the manor as formerly, for
in proportion as their labour services were no longer
necessary, their lord would let them leave the manor and
seek employment, or take up some manufacturing industry,
elsewhere. It had always been possible for the
villeins (or serfs) to do this on payment of a small fine
(<i>capitagium</i>), and it is certain that
as money payments <span id="p070" class="xxpn">{70}</span>
became increasingly the fashion, the lord would not object
to receiving this further payment, unless perchance
he would require a good deal of labour done upon his
own land.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
The Famine and the Plague</h4>—The position of
the labouring class had been further improved by the
effects of the famines which occurred in <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1315–16. Of
course they suffered great hardships and their numbers
were considerably thinned, but at the same time this loss
of life and diminution in their numbers caused their
services to become more valuable in proportion to their
scarcity, and they gained a rise of some 20 per cent. in
wages. From this date till the coming of the Great
Plague, some thirty years later, they and the rest of the
English people enjoyed a period of great prosperity. It
was on the whole a “merry England” on which the
Great Plague suddenly broke. The prosperity of the
people was reflected in the splendour and brilliancy of the
court and aristocracy, and the national pride had been
increased by the recent victory of Crecy, and by the other
successes in the French war, which brought not only
glory but occasionally wealth, in the shape of heavy
ransoms. But in 1348 the prosperity and pride of the
nation was overwhelmed with gloom. The Great Plague
came with sudden and mysterious steps from Asia to
Italy, and thence to Western Europe and England,
carried some say by travelling merchants, or borne with
its infection on the wings of the wind. It arrived in
England at the two great ports of Bristol and Southampton
in August 1348, and thence spread all over the
land. Its ravages were frightful. Whole districts were
depopulated, and about one-third of the people perished.
Norwich and London, being busy and crowded towns,
suffered especially from the pestilence,
and though the <span id="p071" class="xxpn">{71}</span>
numbers of the dead have been grossly exaggerated by
the panic of contemporaries and the credulity of modern
historians,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn23" id="fnanc23">23</a>
there can be no doubt that the loss of life
was enormous.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The effects of the Plague on wages</h4>—The most
immediate consequence of the Plague was a marked
scarcity in the number of labourers available. For being
of the poorest class they naturally succumbed more
readily to famine and sickness. This scarcity of labour
naturally resulted in higher wages. The land-owners
began to fear that their lands would not be cultivated
properly, and were content to buy labour at higher prices
than would have been given at a time when the necessity
of the labourer to the capitalist was more obscured.
Hence the wages of labourers rose far above the customary
rates. In harvest-work, for example, the rise
was nearly 60 per cent., and what is more it remained so
for a long period; the rise in agricultural wages generally
was 50 per cent. So it was also in the case of artisans’
wages, in the case of carpenters, masons, and others.
It seems the upper classes and the capitalists of that
day very strongly objected to paying high wages, as
they naturally do. The king himself felt deeply upon
the point. Without waiting for Parliament to meet,
Edward III. issued a proclamation ordering that no man
should either demand or pay the higher rates of wages,
but should abide by the old rate. He forbade labourers
to leave the land to which they were attached, and
assigned heavy penalties to the runaways. Parliament
assembled in 1349 and eagerly ratified
this proclamation, <span id="p072" class="xxpn">{72}</span>
in the laws known as the <i>Statutes of Labourers</i>. But the
demand for labour was so great that such legislative
endeavours to prevent its proper payment were fortunately
ineffective. Runaways not only found shelter, but
also good employment and high wages. Parliament
fulminated its threats in vain; and in vain increased its
penalties, by a later Statute of 1360 ordering those who
asked more than the old wages to be imprisoned, and, if
they were fugitives, to be branded with hot irons. For
once the labourer was able to meet the capitalist on equal
terms.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc23" id="fn23">23</a>
It was asserted by the fourteenth-century chroniclers, and
has often been repeated since, that nearly 60,000 people died
in Norwich alone. As a matter of fact, the whole county of
Norfolk, including that city, hardly contained 30,000 people.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
Prices of provisions</h4>—Now, although there was a
great rise in the price of labour, the price of the labourers’
food did not rise in proportion. The price of provisions,
indeed, was but little affected, for food did not require
much manual labour in its production, and hence the rise
of wages would not be much felt here. What <i>did</i> rise
was the price of all articles that required much labour
in their production, or the cost of which depended
entirely upon human labour. The price of fish, for
instance, is determined almost entirely by the cost of the
fisherman’s labour, and the cost of transit. Consequently
we should under these circumstances expect a great rise
in the price of fish, and such indeed was the case. So,
too, there was an enormous increase in the prices of tiles,
wheels, canvas, lead, ironwork, and all agricultural
materials, these being articles whose value depends
chiefly upon the amount of labour spent over them, and
upon the cost of that labour. Hence, both peasant and
artisan gained higher wages, while the cost of living
remained for them much the same; and those who
suffered most were the owners of large estates, who had
to pay more for the labour which worked these estates,
and more too for the implements used
in working them.</div>

<div id="p073" class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Effects of the Plague upon the land-owners</h4>—The
fact that the larger land-owners found the cost of working
their land doubled or even trebled caused important economic
changes. Before the Plague the cost of harvesting
upon an ordinary estate, quoted by Professor Rogers, was
£3, 13<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>: afterwards it rose to £12, 19<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> Moreover,
the landlord had to consent to receive lower rents,
for many tenants could not work their farms profitably
with the old rents, and the new prices for labour and
implements. And, as rent is paid out of the profits of
agriculture, it was obvious even to the landlord that
smaller profits meant lower rents. Now, in this state of
things, the landlord had two courses open to him. He
could turn off the tenant and cultivate all his land himself;
or he could try and exist upon the smaller income
gained from lower rents. It was obviously impossible
for him to cultivate all his land himself, for he would have
to employ a large number of bailiffs for his various
manors, and trust to their honesty to do their best for
him. Moreover, he would have to pay his bailiffs, while
after all his tenants paid him something, though less than
formerly. So he decided to allow his tenants to pay him
a smaller rent. What is more, he decided under the circumstances
to give up farming altogether, and let even
the lands which he had reserved for his own cultivation.
The landlords, in fact, had not apparently either the
ability or the inclination to superintend agriculture under
these changed conditions, and gave up trying to work
their land themselves. So that one great result of the
Plague was that landlords to a large extent gave up
capitalist farming upon their own account, and let their
tenants cultivate the soil, and also pay them for continuing
to do so.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
Rise of the tenant farmer
or yeoman class</h4>—The <span id="p074" class="xxpn">{74}</span>
natural effect of this change on the part of the land-owners
was that the small peasant farmers greatly
increased in numbers. The circumstances of the time
favoured them, for the rise in the price of labour was not
so severely felt by them, since they could and did use the
unpaid labour of their families upon their holdings.
Then, when they had tided over the immediate results
of the Plague, they took larger holdings as they grew
richer. They were helped in this by the stock and land
lease system already referred to (p. <a href="#p042" title="go to p. 42">42</a>), which gave them
the use of a larger quantity of agricultural capital than
they could otherwise have commanded. But when the
tenant farmer’s wealth increased he found himself able,
as a rule, to keep his own stock.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
The emancipation of the villeins</h4>—The gradual
amelioration of the conditions of villeinage or serfage
received a forcible impetus from the Great Plague.
Those villeins who had not already become free tenants,
and especially those who lived on wages, shared in the
advantages now gained by all who had labour to sell.
Their labour was more valuable, and they were able with
their higher wages to buy from their lord a commutation
of those exactions which interfered with their personal
freedom of action, with their right to sell their labour
to other employers, or with their endeavours to reach a
better social position. Serfage or villeinage gradually
became practically extinct after the Plague,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn24" id="fnanc24">24</a>
though the
landowners, backed up by the lawyers, interposed many
obstacles in the path of emancipation, and a great
Revolt was necessary to enable the villeins to show their
power. This Revolt and its success must now engage
our attention.</div>

<h3 id="p075">CHAPTER V
<span class="hsmall">
THE PEASANTS’ REVOLT OF 1381, AND THE SUBSEQUENT
PROSPERITY OF THE WORKING CLASSES</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
New social doctrines</h4>—By no means the least
important among the effects of the Great Plague was the
spirit of independence which it helped to raise in the
breasts of the villeins and labourers, more especially
as they now gained some consciousness of the power of
labour, and of its value as a prime necessity in the economic
life of the nation. There was indeed a revolutionary
spirit in the air in the last quarter of the fourteenth
century, and the villeins could not help breathing it.
The social teaching of the author of <i>Peres the Plowman</i>,
with his outspoken denunciation of those who are called
the upper classes; the bold religious teaching of Wiklif
and the wandering friars, and the marked political
assertion of the rights of Parliament by the “Good
Parliament” of 1376, were all manifestations of this
spirit. It was natural, too, that, feeling their power as
they did, the villeins should become restive when they
heard from the followers of Wiklif that, as it was lawful
to withdraw tithes from priests who lived in sin, so
“servants and tenants may withdraw their services
and rents from their lords that live openly a cursed
life.”</div></div><!--section-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
The coming of the Friars. Wiklif</h4>—Such indeed
was the teaching that Wiklif promulgated, and it was
carried throughout all England by that great association
of wandering friars which he founded under the title of
the “poor priests.” These men
were like the <span id="p076" class="xxpn">{76}</span>
mendicant friars who had come to England a century
before&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn25" id="fnanc25">25</a>
to work in the poorer parts of the English towns; only
Wiklif’s priests generally wandered out into the isolated
and remote country villages, and spread abroad the
independent doctrines and the revolutionary spirit of
the times. Spending their lives in moving about among
the “upland folk,” as the country people were called,
clad in coarse, undyed brown woollen garments, they
won the confidence of the peasants, and what is more,
helped them to combine in very effectual trade unions.
They acted as treasurers for the common funds of these
peasants’ unions, and served as messengers between
those in different parts of the country, having passwords
and a secret language of their own. Their preaching was
similar to that of the celebrated priest of Kent, John
Ball, who for twenty years before the great rising
(1360–80) openly spoke words like these: “Good people,
things will never be well in England so long as there be
villeins and gentlemen. By what right are they whom
we call lords greater than we? On what grounds have
they deserved it? Why do they hold us in serfage?
They have leisure and fine houses: we have pain and
labour, and the wind and rain in the fields. And yet
it is of us and our toil that these men hold their estate.”
These searching questions as to the rights of the lords, and
the bold but true statement that it was the villeins and
labouring classes who supported—and paid for—their
high estate, came closely home to the peasants. They
were encouraged too by the independent religious views
of the Lollards, and it is said that half England held their
views. And this independence of social and religious
tenets was hardly calculated to
make the villeins bear <span id="p077" class="xxpn">{77}</span>
with equanimity the exactions of their lords after the
Great Plague.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc25" id="fn25">25</a>
The Black Friars of Dominic came in 1221, and the Grey
Friars of Francis in 1224.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
The renewed exactions of the landlords</h4>—For it
must be remembered that the Great Plague did not
immediately emancipate the villeins, or cause the land-owners
to give up farming on their own account. The
process, of course, took a few years, and in these
few years the land-owners made desperate efforts to
avoid paying higher wages than formerly for labour.
As it had now become costly, they insisted more
severely upon the performance by their tenants of
such labour-dues as were not yet commuted for
money payments. They even tried to make those
tenants who had emerged from a condition of villeinage
to a free tenancy, return back to villeinage again,
with all its old labour-dues and casual services. If
a man could not prove by legal documentary evidence
that he held his land in a free tenancy, the land-owner
might pretend he was a villein tenant, and subject to all
a villein’s services, although these services might long
ago have been commuted for a money rent without any
legal formality. There is much reason to believe, moreover,
that they abused their power of inflicting “amercements,”
or fines, upon their tenants in the manor courts
for trivial breaches of duty. So at least Wiklif and the
author of <i>Peres the Plowman</i> tell us. The villeins
naturally resisted this attempt to make a retrograde
movement, which would force them back into the old
bondage from which they had redeemed themselves;
the free tenants supported them, for they knew their
turn would come next if the serfs failed; and the
labouring classes eagerly joined the movement also,
in hopes of getting rid of the vexatious Statutes of
Labourers.</div>

<div id="p078" class="dh4">
<h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The Peasants’ Revolt</h4>&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn26" id="fnanc26">26</a>—The
crisis came in 1381,
and was perhaps precipitated by the oppressive manner
in which the poll-tax was collected. But the poll-tax
itself was not the real cause of the revolt. The rising had
long been foreseen, and arrangements had been duly made
among the peasants’ unions by the poor priests, their
agents and messengers, who formed the connecting links
between all the labour organizations of the land. A
sudden rising took place, as unanimous as it was unanticipated,
throughout all England, from Scarborough
to Kent and Devon. Almost simultaneously the peasants
showed their combined strength, and a large body of
them under Wat Tyler marched upon London. It is
well known how they met the young King Richard II.
at Mile-end, and demanded of him the petition which
shows the real meaning of the movement: “We will
that you free us for ever, us and our lands,” they asked;
“and that we be never named or held as villeins.” “I
grant it,” said the king, with regal diplomacy, and the
peasants believed him. But they very soon learned how
vain a thing it is to put one’s trust in princes, for after
the peasant armies in the various parts of England had
quieted down, and the Essex men, among others, claimed
the fulfilment of his royal promise, Richard openly broke
faith. “Villeins you were,” said the king, “and villeins
you are. In bondage shall you abide, and that not your
old bondage, but a worse!” Fortunately this never
happened. Although suppressed, the rising was practically
successful, for it had shown the power of the combination
of labour, in the great strife between labour and
capital. A few of the ringleaders were imprisoned and
executed, among them being
several priests. The <span id="p079" class="xxpn">{79}</span>
authorities of course blustered, and swore they would
never give in. Equally of course they did give in; no
further attempts were made to exact labour-dues or
<i>corvées</i>; and within a generation or so villeinage or
serfage became practically extinct&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn27" id="fnanc27">27</a>; and the villeins
became known as copyholders or tenants by custom.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
The Condition of the English labourer</h4>—After this great
insurrection came what has been termed the golden age of the English
labourer, and it lasted all through the fifteenth century. Food was
cheap and abundant; wages were amply sufficient. True, the employers
of labour still tried, by various petitions and Acts (<i>e.g.</i> 7 Henry
IV., 4 Henry V., 23 Henry VI., 11 Henry VII.), to enforce the Statute
of Labourers, but they were practically unsuccessful, and prosperity
was progressive and continuous till the evil days of Henry VIII. The
wages of a good agricultural labourer, before the Plague, had been £2,
7<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> per year as an average, including the labour of his wife
and child; after the Plague his wages would be £3, 15<i>s.</i>, and the
cost of his living certainly not more than £3, 4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> An artisan,
working 300 days a year, would get, say, <span class="nowrap">£3,
18<i>s.</i> 1&#x2060;½<i>d.</i></span> before 1348, and after that date <span
class="nowrap">£5, 15<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>,</span> which was so far above the cost
of maintenance as to give him a very comfortable position. His working
day, too, was not excessive, while the fixed rents of the time were
very low. These low rents were also one great cause of the prosperity
of the new yeoman, or tenant farmer class (p. <a href="#p073" title="go to p. 73">73</a>) that had arisen
after the collapse of the capitalist land-owners in consequence of the
Plague. This class remained for at least two centuries the backbone of
English agriculture.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Drawbacks</h4>—There were, however, a few drawbacks
in this “golden age,” as various
critics have told <span id="p080" class="xxpn">{80}</span>
us. The ordinary hardships of human life were in many
respects greater than they are now—disease was more
deadly, and the risks of life more numerous&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn28" id="fnanc28">28</a>; but from
this very fact the extremes of poverty and wealth were
less widely distinguished and less acutely felt; and,
although it cannot be asserted that people did not
occasionally die of want in very bad times, yet the
grinding and hopeless poverty just above the verge of
actual starvation, so often prevalent in the present time,
did not belong to mediæval life. The chief hardships to
be encountered were in the winter, for, owing to the
absence of winter roots, stock could only be kept in
limited quantities, and the only meat procurable was
that which had been previously salted. It is certain that
much of mediæval disease is traceable to the excessive
use of salted provisions. The houses, also, were rudely
built of mud, clay, or even wattled material, for brickmaking
was a lost art, and stone was only used for the
manor-houses and the dwellings of the wealthy. But
food was abundant and cheap. The cost of living was
not more than one-tenth of what it is at the present day.
Three pounds of beef could be bought for a penny; a
pig cost about fourpence; beer was only a halfpenny
a gallon. Employment was fairly constant and regular,
and in addition to their wages, labourers still possessed
the valuable old manorial common rights of common
pasture and forest.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc28" id="fn28">28</a>
The question is more fully treated in <i>Industry in England</i>,
ch. xii. (end).</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
The close of the Middle Ages</h4>—So things went on
happily after the Great Revolt, and in the days of the
fourth and fifth Henries. The brilliant, but useless,
French victories of the latter monarch were paid for
partly by the prosperous middle and
lower classes, and <span id="p081" class="xxpn">{81}</span>
partly by the French themselves; and very costly they
were. England was still mainly agricultural, but
manufactures were growing. Though wool was still
exported, much was being worked up in the towns and
villages. Artisans earned about 3<i>s.</i> a week, which would
certainly be worth more than 30<i>s.</i> a week at present.
Industry, as will be remembered, was organized in the
craft gilds, and apparently the gild system was a success
till its restrictions in towns began to cramp the growing
manufactures. The fifteenth century was a period of
prosperity and content, in spite of both civil and foreign
wars; and even the wasteful reign of Henry VI., with
its unsuccessful war with France, and huge subsidies to
Rome, though it made the Government unpopular and
caused widespread national discontent and occasional
insurrections in Kent and Wiltshire, did not materially
injure the general prosperity. The king himself, however,
was nearly bankrupt. The Wars of the Roses
which followed (1455–86) did not affect the country
at large, being fought in a series of much exaggerated
skirmishes by small bodies of nobles and their followers.
They ended in the very desirable consummation of the
ruin of the remnants of the feudal aristocracy, and at
the same time opened a further path for the influence of
the industrial classes, whose favour Henry VII. had the
wisdom to court, and in return was supported by them in
his policy of weakening the power of the great barons.
He encouraged commerce,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn29" id="fnanc29">29</a>
and aided the prosperity of
his kingdom, thereby amassing for his own treasury
considerable wealth. In his reign the feudal system was

<h3>CHAPTER I
<span class="hsmall">
THE MISDEEDS OF HENRY VIII., AND ECONOMIC CHANGES
IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
Henry VIII.’s wastefulness</h4>—Henry VIII. came to
the throne in 1509. He succeeded to a full treasury left
by his thrifty father, and replenished by contributions
from the general prosperity of the country at the close of
the fifteenth century. But he soon dissipated the whole
of these accumulations. He spent a great deal of money
in subsidizing the needy Emperor of Germany, Maximilian,
and in interfering in foreign affairs which were
better left alone, in the hope of winning for himself a
military reputation. His Continental wars and alliances
cost him dear, or rather they cost the English people dear,
for they gave him liberal grants of money (as <i>e.g.</i> in 1513)
before he set out on his fruitless expeditions. But even
in time of peace his expenditure was equally extravagant.
The cost of his household establishments, and those of his
children, was simply enormous; for the establishments
of Mary, Edward, and even Elizabeth were each more
costly than the whole annual charge of his father’s household.
His extravagance was monumental, though where
his money went he could not
himself discover. Wolsey <span id="p084" class="xxpn">{84}</span>
said of him, “Rather than miss any part of his will, he
will endanger one-half of his kingdom.” As a matter of
fact he succeeded in impoverishing the whole of it.</div></div><!--chapter-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
The dissolution of the monasteries</h4>—He soon wasted
the carefully accumulated treasures of his father, and
sought for further supplies. They were gained at first
by increased taxation, but as this money was spent in the
French wars, Henry was soon in difficulties again. Then
he tried another expedient. The monasteries suggested
themselves to him as an easy prey, and he knew that an
attack upon them would not displease the growing Protestant
party in the country. These institutions were in
many cases not fulfilling their ancient functions properly,
and were often far from being the homes of religious
virtue. So excuses were easily found, and in 1536 the
smaller monasteries with an income below £200 a year
were suppressed, and in 1539 the larger ones were similarly
treated. About 1000 houses were suppressed, the <i>annual</i>
income of which was £161,000, equivalent to more than
two millions sterling of our present money. Half-a-dozen
bishoprics and a few grammar schools were founded out of
the proceeds of this spoliation, in order to blind the eyes of
the people at large. But with these paltry exceptions the
whole of that vast capital and revenue was granted to
courtiers and favourites, sold at nominal prices, or
gambled away by the king and his satellites.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Results of the suppression</h4>—Although the mass
of the people did not protest very vigorously against this
piece of royal robbery, many of them witnessed with silent
dismay the destruction of ancient institutions that had
formed so integral a part of the national life. A few
even expressed their discontent in open insurrection, and
risings took place in Lincolnshire and
Yorkshire,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn30" id="fnanc30">30</a>
but these <span id="p085" class="xxpn">{85}</span>
were put down. The economic disturbances which
resulted were not so clearly seen, but were far more
severe. They were acute enough from the mere fact of
so much wealth having suddenly changed hands and
being spent with reckless prodigality. It is said that
one-fifth, or even one-third, of the land in the kingdom
was held by the monasteries, and it was now transferred
from the holding of the Church into the hands of a new set
of nobles and landed gentry, created from the dependants
and time-servers of Henry’s court. These were enriched,
but the former tenants of the monasteries and the poorer
class of labourers suffered greatly. Hence serious results
followed. Nearly all monastic lands were held by tenants
upon the “stock and land lease” system, spoken of before;
but, when these monastic lands were suddenly transferred
into the clutches of Henry’s new and needy nobility, the
stock was confiscated and sold off, while the money rent
was raised. The new owners did not care for the slow,
though really lucrative, system of providing the tenant
with a certain amount of stock for his land, but simply
wished to get all the money they could without delay.
The result was that the poorer tenants were almost
ruined, and it seems probable that pauperism was greatly
increased. What small amount of pauperism had previously
existed had been sufficiently relieved by the monasteries,
who, owing their wealth to charitable offerings,
could not well refuse charity to those that needed it; but
on their dissolution pauperism had no longer such relief,
and very soon we shall see it became necessary to provide
that relief by law. With the dissolution the history of
English legal pauperism may be said to begin, although
of course other causes contributed to its growth. But
among these causes the spoliation of the monasteries had
no unimportant place.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc30" id="fn30">30</a>
<i>e.g.</i> “The Pilgrimage of Grace,” 1536.</p></div>

<div id="p086" class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The issuing of base coin</h4>—Four years after the dissolution,
Henry was in difficulties again. He dared not
ask his Parliament for further supplies so soon after his
last piece of plunder, so he betook himself to a still more
wicked kind of robbery. In 1543 he began to debase the
currency, and repeated this criminal action in 1545 and
1546. This debasement forms a landmark in English
industrial history as disastrous as the other landmark of
the Great Plague. Its effect was not felt immediately,
but it was none the less real. The chief point that concerned
the labourer was that prices rapidly rose, but that,
as is always the case, the rise of wages did not coincide
with this inflation, and when they did rise they did not do
so in a fair proportion. The necessaries of life rose in
proportion of one to two and one-half; wages, when they
finally rose, only in the proportion of one to one and one-half.
When too late it was recognized that the issue of
base money was the cause of dearth in the realm, and
Latimer lamented the fact in his sermons. Meanwhile,
the mischief had been done.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
The confiscation of the gild lands</h4>—What Henry did
with his gains thus obtained by underhand robbery cannot
be accurately discovered. But it soon went, for he
again required a supply of money.</div>

<p>One other method of robbing the industrial classes still
remained, and though Henry died, his ministers were not
slow to take advantage of it. This step was the confiscation
of the gild lands, planned by Henry VIII. but finally
carried out by his son’s guardian, Somerset. These lands
had been acquired by the craft gilds both in town and
country, partly by bequests from members, and partly by
purchase from the funds of the gilds. The revenues of
these lands were used for lending, without usury, to poorer
members of the gilds, for apprenticing
poor children, for <span id="p087" class="xxpn">{87}</span>
widows’ pensions, and, above all, for the relief of destitute
members of the craft. Thus the labourer of that time had
in the funds of the gild a kind of insurance money, while
the gild itself fulfilled all the functions of a benefit society.
Now, Henry VIII. got an Act passed for the confiscation
of this and other property, but died before his scheme was
carried out. It was then Somerset who procured the
Act for perpetrating this offence—on the plea that these
lands were associated with superstitious uses. Only the
property of the London gilds was left untouched. The
gilds had relieved pauperism in the Middle Ages, assisted
in steadying the price of labour, and formed a centre for
associations that fulfilled a want now only partially
supplied by modern trade unions. Their abolition was a
heavy blow to the English labourer.</p>

<p>Why this abolition was not more generally resented is
a point of some interest. In the first place, the religious
gilds and craft gilds were suppressed together on the plea
above mentioned, and thus the difference between them
was confused. Then again, the London gilds were spared
because of their power, and thus it was made their interest
not to interfere with the destruction of their provincial
brethren. The nobles were bought off with presents
gained from the funds of the gilds. Moreover, the <i>craft</i>
gilds in the country towns were becoming close corporations,
whose advantages were often monopolized by a few
powerful members. This led, as we saw, to the manufacture
of cloth being spread from the towns into industrial
villages in the rural districts, where perhaps the
mass of the population, not perceiving the full significance
of the act, did not object to a measure which struck
a blow at the town “mysteries.” But, nevertheless, a
great deal of discontent was aroused. Somerset became
very unpopular, and insurrections broke
out in many <span id="p088" class="xxpn">{88}</span>
parts of the country, the most dangerous being in Cornwall,
Devonshire, and in the West. They were caused
not only by this spoliation but by agrarian discontent as
well, but German and Italian mercenaries were introduced
to put them down, and the protests of the people
were everywhere choked in their blood.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
The agrarian situation</h4>—Such were the acts instigated
or actually performed by that miserable monarch,
whom nevertheless not a few people who write history
seek to glorify. Possibly they do so in ignorance of the
facts. This much is certain, that Henry VIII.’s reign witnessed
growing pauperism in a country which had been
a few years previously in a state of considerable material
comfort. But before the close of his reign the labouring
classes became impoverished, and tenant farmers were
ruined with high rents exacted by the new nobility. The
landed gentry and nobility, however, profited by this,
and the merchants grew rich by their accumulations in
foreign trade. But those who depended directly upon the
cultivation of the land for their living suffered severely.
There had been for some years past a steady rise in the
price of wool for export, partly because the manufacturers
of the Netherlands were so flourishing, and partly owing
to a general rise of prices on the Continent since the great
discoveries of silver in South America. Land-owners saw
that it was more immediately profitable to turn their
arable land into pasture, and go in for sheep farming
on a large scale. They therefore did three things. They
evicted as many as possible of their smaller tenants, and
as Sir Thomas More tells us: “in this way it comes to
pass that these poor wretches, men, women, husbands,
orphans, parents with little children—all these emigrate
from their native fields without knowing where to go.”
Then they raised the rents of the
larger tenants, the <span id="p089" class="xxpn">{89}</span>
yeomen and farmers, so that, as Latimer mentions, land for
which his father had paid £3 or £4 a year, was in 1549 let
at £16, almost to the ruin of the tenant. Thirdly, the
large land-owners took from the poor their common lands
by an unscrupulous system of enclosures. Wolsey had
in vain endeavoured to stop their doing this, for he had
sagacity enough to perceive how it would pauperize the
labourers and others who had valuable rights in such
land. But enclosures and evictions went on in spite of
his enactments, with the inevitable result of social disorders.</div>

<p>The most important of these risings took place in Norfolk,
where enclosures had been made upon a tremendous
scale. Ket, a wealthy tanner of Norwich, took the lead
(in 1549) of a large body of some 16,000 tenants and
labourers, who demanded the abolition of the late enclosures
and the reform of other local abuses. The Earl
of Warwick defeated the petitioners in a battle, put down
the rising, and hanged Ket at Norwich Castle. The
farmers and peasantry were thus cowed into submission.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
Other economic changes</h4>—From these facts it became
evident that the old mediæval industrial system was
breaking up in England. The new life created by the
Renaissance caused a keener and more eager spirit among
all classes of men. Competition began to operate as a
new force, and men made haste to grow rich. The merchants
were becoming bolder and more enterprising in
their ventures. The discoveries of America by Columbus
(1492) and by Cabot (1497), and of the sea-route to India
by Vasco da Gama (1498), had kindled a desire to share
largely in the wealth of these newly accessible countries.
At home the lords of the manors no longer remained in
close personal relationships with their tenants. The
tenants were no longer villeins,
but were nominally <span id="p090" class="xxpn">{90}</span>
independent, and had certain rights. But the lords of the
manors had small respect for rights that were only
guarded by custom; and evicted or oppressed their
tenants to such an extent that multitudes of dispossessed
and impoverished villagers flocked to the towns. In fact
Sir Thomas More tells us that the tenants “were got rid of
by fraud or force, or tired out by repeated wrongs into
parting with their property.”</div>

<p>Many labourers, too, could be found wandering from
place to place, begging or robbing. The old steady village
life, with its isolation and strong home ties, was undergoing
a violent transition. Constant work and regular
wages were becoming things of the past. The labourer’s
wages would not purchase the former quantity of provisions
under the new high prices caused by the debasement
of the currency, and the discoveries of silver from
1540–1600; for wages, though they ultimately follow
prices, do so very slowly, and not always even then proportionately.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
Summary of the changes of the sixteenth century</h4>—Such
were the events which caused so great an economic
transition in this period. They resulted in the pauperization
of a large portion of the working classes, and the impoverishment
of the small farmers. On the other hand,
the nobles and land-owners gained considerable wealth.
The merchants also were exceedingly flourishing, and
foreign trade was growing. In summing up, then, we
may say that the suppression of the monasteries, and the
creation of a new nobility from the adventurers of Henry
VIII.’s court, who obtained most of the monastic wealth;
the debasement of the coinage and the exaltation in
prices, aided largely (1540–1600) by the discovery of new
silver mines in South America; the rise in the price of
wool both for export and
home manufacture, coupled <span id="p091" class="xxpn">{91}</span>
with the consequent increase in sheep farming and the
practice of enclosure of land—all produced most important
economic changes in the history of English labour and
industry. To these we must add, towards the end of the
sixteenth century, the great immigration of Flemings,
chiefly after 1567, owing to the continual persecutions of
Alva and other Spanish rulers. This gave a great impetus
to English manufactures, its effects, however, being
chiefly felt in the seventeenth century, when another immigration
took place. Finally, in the sixteenth century
were laid the foundations of our present commercial enterprise
and maritime trade, by the voyages of Drake and
other great sea-captains of Elizabeth’s reign. Their expeditions,
it is true, were mainly buccaneering exploits,
but they created a spirit of maritime enterprise that bore
good fruit in the following reigns. Nor indeed was trade
even in the previous centuries entirely insignificant, but
had considerably developed, as the following chapter will
show.</div>

<div class="section padtopb">
<h3>CHAPTER II
<span class="hsmall">
THE GROWTH OF FOREIGN TRADE</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
The expansion of commerce. The new spirit</h4>—Just
as the beginning of the sixteenth century marks
what may be called an economic revolution in the home
industries of the country, so too it marks the beginning of
international commerce upon the modern scale. The
economic revolution, of which the new agricultural system
and the practice of enclosures was the most striking
feature, was a change from the old dependent, uncompetitive,
and regulated industrial system,
to one under <span id="p092" class="xxpn">{92}</span>
which Capital and Labour grew up as separate forces in
the form in which we recognize them now. Labour
had become nominally independent after the Peasants’
Revolt of 1381, and at the same time it consciously felt
that it was in opposition to capitalist and land-owning
interests. In its desire for freedom it had also begun to
shake off even its self-imposed restrictions, and the power
of the gilds had rapidly waned. A new and eager spirit
came with the Renaissance and the Reformation, a spirit
which on the economic side showed itself in the development
of competition, the shaking off of old restraints, and
in more daring and far-seeing enterprises. Especially
was this the case among the merchants, fired as they were
by the great discoveries of the latter end of the fifteenth
century, and hence we notice, throughout the sixteenth
century and especially at its close, that our foreign trade
becomes more extensive than it had ever been before, and
the foundations of our present international commerce
were securely laid.</div></div><!--section-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Foreign trade in the fifteenth century</h4>—At this
point we must look back for a moment at our foreign trade
before this new epoch. Although our enterprises were by
no means large, there was yet a fairly considerable trade
done with the countries in the west of Europe—<i>i.e.</i> France,
Spain, and the Baltic lands, and especially with the Low
Countries. As England was then almost entirely an
agricultural country, our chief export was wool for the
Flemish looms to work up; but there was also other agricultural
produce exported; and likewise some mineral
products. In fact England supplied nearly all Western
Europe with two most important metals, tin and lead;
the former coming chiefly from Cornwall and the latter
from Derbyshire, though in neither case exclusively from
those counties. Bodmin was, however,
the staple town <span id="p093" class="xxpn">{93}</span>
for the export of tin. Our huge mineral wealth in coal
and iron was hardly yet touched, even for home use, and
none was exported. Our imports were numerous and
varied, their number being balanced, as they must always
be, by the greater bulk and value of our exports of wool
and lead.</div>

<p>A fair amount of trade was done with Portugal and
Spain, which sent us iron and war-horses; Gascony and
other parts of France sent their wines; rich velvets,
linens, and fine cloths were imported from Ghent, Liège,
Bruges, and other Flemish manufacturing towns. The
ships of the Hanse merchants brought herrings, wax,
timber, fur and amber from the Baltic countries; and
Genoese traders came with silks and velvets and glass of
Italy. And all met one another, as we saw before, in the
great fairs, as at Stourbridge, or in the great trading
centre of the Western world, London.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
The Venetian fleet</h4>—But our most important trade
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries centred round
the annual visit of the Venetian fleet to the southern
shores of England. This was a great company of trading
vessels, which left Venice every year upon a visit to
England and Flanders.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn31" id="fnanc31">31</a>
Our English vessels did not at
this time venture into the Mediterranean, and so all the
stores of the Southern European countries, and more
especially the treasures of the East, came to us through
the agency of Venice. Laden with silks, satins, fine
damasks and cottons, and other then costly garments,
together with rare Eastern spices and precious stones,
camphor and saffron, this fleet sailed slowly along the
shores of the Mediterranean, trading at the ports of Italy,
South France and Spain, till it passed through the Straits
of Gibraltar, and at length came
up the Channel, and <span id="p094" class="xxpn">{94}</span>
reached our southern ports. When it had reached the
Downs, the fleet broke up for a time, some vessels putting
in at Sandwich, Rye, and other towns, and a large number
stopping at Southampton. Others went on to Flanders.
Several days, sometimes weeks, were spent in exchanging
their valuable cargoes for English goods, chiefly wool,
the balance being paid over in gold, and then the various
portions of the great fleet would reunite again, and set
sail for Venice, from which they were often absent for
nearly a twelvemonth. This annual visit was very convenient
for English traders, before our own merchants
ventured far away from our coasts. But it is a sign of the
increased commercial enterprise of England in the sixteenth
century that this visit then became unprofitable,
and the last time the Venetian fleet came to our shores
was in 1587.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc31" id="fn31">31</a>
Hence the Venetians themselves called it the “Flanders fleet.”</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The Hanseatic League’s station in London</h4>—While
our commerce was, however, not yet so greatly developed,
there existed another important institution carried on by
foreign merchants, this time from Germany. The Hanse,
or Hanseatic League, was started in the twelfth century
by some of the leading trading towns of Germany, such as
Hamburg and Lübeck, and after a time these towns
formed themselves into a League for mutual protection
among the constant Continental wars, and became a sort
of republic (1241). In another century (by 1360) it had
grown so large and powerful that ninety cities belonged
to the confederacy, and it had branches or depots in every
important town of Northern Europe. Of course there
was also a branch at London, in the “Steelyard,” on
which spot the Cannon Street Station now stands. This
branch had existed from very early times, and a warehouse
was there in which the German merchants stored
their goods. In Richard II.’s time
this building was <span id="p095" class="xxpn">{95}</span>
enlarged, and so it was again in the reign of Edward IV.
Round it dwelt the foreign merchants who formed quite
a little colony in the very heart of mediæval London.
Here they held a kind of chamber of commerce, presided
over by an alderman, with two co-assessors, and nine
council-men, and meeting regularly on Wednesday mornings
in every week. The Steelyard colony existed for
some hundreds of years, and taught many valuable commercial
lessons to our English merchants. It provided
for us a regular supply of the produce of Russia, Germany,
and Norway, especially timber and naval stores, and also
corn when our English harvest fell short. But as our own
merchants grew more prosperous and their commerce
extended, they became jealous of the German colony.
Attacks were made upon it by London mobs, and
Edward VI. actually rescinded its charter. That was
the beginning of the end. Mary restored it for a time,
but towards the close of Elizabeth’s reign (1597) it was
finally abolished. This, too, was another sign of the
growth of our own foreign trade.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
Our trade with Flanders. Antwerp in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries</h4>—We have mentioned before how
the eastern ports and harbours of England used to swarm
with small, light craft that plied all the summer through
between our own country and Flanders. We have seen
too that this continuous trade was due to the fact that
we supplied the Flemish looms with wool. Up to the
fifteenth century the great Flemish emporium, to which
our English ships plied, was Bruges, but in the sixteenth
century this town quite lost its former glory, and Antwerp
took its place. The change was due to the action of
Maximilian, the Emperor of Germany, to whom Henry
VIII. was allied, and who, in revenge for a rebellion in
which Ghent and Bruges took part,
caused the canal <span id="p096" class="xxpn">{96}</span>
which connected Bruges with the sea to be blocked up at
Sluys (1482), and thus English and other ships were compelled
to direct their course to Antwerp, which then became
a great and flourishing port. Antwerp remained
without a rival till near the close of the sixteenth century,
and every nation had its representatives there. Our own
consul, to use a modern term, was, at the close of the
fifteenth century, Sir Richard Gresham; and later, in the
reign of Henry VIII., his celebrated son, the financier and
economist, Sir Thomas Gresham. The fact of our having
these representatives there is again a proof of the growth
of trade in the sixteenth century. An Italian author,
Ludovico Guicciardini (who died in 1589), gives a very
precise account of our own commerce with Antwerp at
this period, and it is interesting to note how varied our
commerce has by this time become. This is what he says
as to our <i>imports</i>: “To England Antwerp sends jewels,
precious stones, silver bullion, quicksilver, wrought silks,
gold and silver cloth and thread, camlets, grograms,
spices, drugs, sugar, cotton, cummin, linens fine and
coarse, serges, tapestry, madder, hops in great quantities,
glass, salt, fish, metallic and other merceries of all sorts;
arms of all kinds, ammunition for war, and household
furniture.” As to our <i>exports</i> he tells us: “From England
Antwerp receives vast quantities of coarse and fine
draperies, fringes and all other things of that kind to a
great value; the finest wool; excellent saffron, but in
small quantities; much lead and tin; sheep and rabbit
skins without number, and various other sorts of the fine
peltry (<i>i.e.</i> skins) and leather; beer, cheese, and other
provisions in great quantities; also Malmsey wines, which
the English import from Candia. It is marvellous to
think of the vast quantity of drapery sent by the English
into the Netherlands.” <span id="p097" class="xxpn">{97}</span></div>

<p>This list is sufficient to show an extensive trade, and we
shall comment upon one or two items of it in the next
chapter. Here we need only remark upon the great
growth of English manufactures of cloth.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
The decay of Antwerp and rise of London as the
Western emporium</h4>—But the prosperity of Antwerp did
not last quite a century. Like all Flemish towns it
suffered severely under the Spanish invasion, and the persecutions
of the notorious Alva. In 1567 it was ruinously
sacked, and its commerce was forced into new channels,
and the disaster was completed by the sacking of the
town again in 1585. Antwerp’s ruin was London’s gain.
Even in 1567, at the time of the first sacking, many Protestant
Flemish merchants fled to England, where, as Sir
Thomas Gresham promised them, they found peace and
welcome, and in their turn gave a great impulse to English
commercial prosperity. Throughout Elizabeth’s reign,
in fact, there was a continual influx of Protestant refugees
to our shores, and Elizabeth and her statesmen had the
sagacity to encourage these industrious and wealthy
immigrants. Besides aiding our manufactures, as we
shall see later, they aided our commerce. In 1588 there
were 38 Flemish merchants established in London, who
subscribed £5000 towards the defence of England against
the Spanish Armada. The greatness of Antwerp was
transferred to London, and although Amsterdam also
gained additional importance in Holland, London now
took the foremost position as the general mart of Europe,
where the new treasures of the two Americas were found
side by side with the products of Europe and the East.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
The merchants and sea-captains of the Elizabethan
age in the New World</h4>—It is thus of interest to note how
the great Reformation conflict between Roman Catholic
and Protestant in Europe resulted
in the commercial <span id="p098" class="xxpn">{98}</span>
greatness of England. Interesting, also, is the story of
the expansion of commerce in the New World, owing to
the attacks of the great old sea-captains, Drake, Frobisher,
and Raleigh, upon the huge Catholic power of
Spain. These attacks were perhaps not much more than
buccaneering exploits, but the leaders of them firmly
believed that they were doing a good service to the cause
of Protestantism and freedom by wounding Spain wherever
they could. And possibly they were right. Their
wondrous voyages stimulated others, likewise, to set out
on far and venturesome expeditions. Men dreamt of a
northern passage to India, and although Willoughby’s
expedition failed, one of his ships under Richard Chancellor
reached Archangel, and thus opened up a direct
trade with Russia; so that in 1554 a company was
formed specially for this trade. It was, too, in Elizabeth’s
reign that the merchants of Southampton entered upon
the trade with the coast of Guinea, and gained much
wealth from its gold-dust and ivory. Sir John Hawkins
engaged in the slave-trade between Africa and the new
fields of labour in America. Bristol fishermen sailed
across the dreaded Atlantic to the cod-fisheries off Newfoundland,
and at the close of Elizabeth’s reign English
ships began to rival the Portuguese in the Polar whale-fisheries.</div>

<p>This reign witnessed also the rise of the great commercial
Companies. The company of Merchant Adventurers
had indeed existed since Henry VII.’s time,
having been formed in imitation of the Hanseatic League.
The Russian Company of 1554 was formed upon the
model of this earlier company; and then came the
foundation of the great East India Company. It was
due to the results of Drake’s far-famed voyage round the
world, which took three years,
1577–80. Shortly after <span id="p099" class="xxpn">{99}</span>
his return it was proposed to found “a company for such
as trade beyond the equinoctial line,” but a long delay
took place, and finally a company was incorporated for
the more definite object of trading with the East Indies.
The date of this famous incorporation was 1600, and in
1601 Captain Lancaster made the first regular trading
voyage on its behalf. To this modest beginning we owe
our present Indian Empire.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
Remarks on the signs and causes of the expansion
of trade</h4>—Now, if we look at the broad features that mark
the growth of sixteenth century trade, we shall see that
it was closely connected with England’s decision to abide
by the Protestant cause. It was that which won her the
friendship of the Flemish merchants; it was the religious
disturbances in Flanders that gained for London the
commercial supremacy of Europe; it was our quarrel
with Roman Catholic Spain that inspired the voyages
of Drake and Hawkins, and thus caused others to venture
forth into new and perilous seas, over which in course of
time the English merchants sailed almost without a rival.
And, as we have shown, the signs of the expansion of
England are seen in the fall of the Hanse settlement in
London, and the stoppage of the visits of the Venetian
fleet. On the other hand the rapid growth of the port
of Bristol in the west witnessed to fresh trade with the
New World; and the rise of Boston and Hull&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn32" id="fnanc32">32</a>
on the
east coast is significant as showing the development of
our Northern and Baltic trade, even to the extent of
rivalling the great Hanse towns. A great stimulus had
arisen, and England was now taking a leading position
among the nations of the world. It is now our business
to survey it as it existed in the time of Elizabeth.</div>

<h3 id="p100">CHAPTER III
<span class="hsmall">
ELIZABETHAN ENGLAND</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
Prosperity and pauperism</h4>—The reign of Elizabeth
is generally regarded as prosperous, and so upon the
whole it was. But she had come to the throne with a
legacy of pauperism from her father, Henry VIII., and
from her father’s counsellors, who guided her weak
brother, Edward VI. Nor had Mary helped to alleviate
it. Social discontent was at Elizabeth’s accession prevalent,
and it is to her credit as a sovereign that at her
death danger from that source had passed away. This
was partly due to the growth of wealth and industry
throughout the kingdom, to the great gains of our foreign
trade, and to the rapid expansion of our manufactures.
But pauperism was now a permanent evil, and legal
measures had to be taken for its relief. One abiding
cause of it was the persistent enclosures which still went
on, together with the new developments in agriculture.
Nevertheless, before the close of her reign the bulk of the
people became contented and comfortable, owing to the
prolonged peace which prevailed. The merchants and
landed gentry were rich; the farmers and master-manufacturers
were prosperous; even the artisans and
labourers were not hopelessly poor, though to call them
well-off would be a misstatement. We may now see
how the wealth of the first two classes was produced.</div>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
The growth of manufactures</h4>—The economic transition
before alluded to (p. <a href="#p055" title="go to p. 55">55</a>), by which England developed
from a wool-exporting into a wool-manufacturing
country, had in Elizabeth’s reign
almost been completed. <span id="p101" class="xxpn">{101}</span>
The woollen manufacture had become an important
element in the national wealth. England no longer sent
her wool to be manufactured in Flanders, although a
good deal of it was dyed there. It was now worked up
at home, and the manufacturing population was not
confined to the towns only, but spread all over the
country; and both spinning and weaving afforded direct
employment for an increasing number of workmen,
while even in agricultural villages it was a frequent
bye-industry. The worsted trade, of which Norwich was
still the centre, spread over all the Eastern counties.
The broad-cloths of the West of England took the highest
place among English woollen stuffs. Even the North,
which had lagged so far behind the South in industrial
development, ever since the harrying it underwent at
the hands of William the Norman, began now to show
signs of activity and new life. It had, in this period,
developed special manufactures of its own, and Manchester
friezes, York coverlets, and Halifax cloth now
held their own amongst the other manufactures of the
country.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Monopolies of manufacturing towns</h4>—One important
sign of the growth of manufactures is seen in the
fruitless attempts made in the sixteenth century to confine
a particular manufacture to a particular town. This
is a sure sign that the manufacture of that article was
increasing in country districts, and that competition was
operating in a new and unexpected way upon the older
industries. An example of this may be seen in the monopoly
granted by Parliament in Henry VIII.’s reign (1530)
to Bridport in Dorsetshire, “for the making of cables,
hawsers, ropes, and all other tackling.” This monopoly
was granted upon the complaint made by the citizens
of Bridport, that their town “was like
to be utterly <span id="p102" class="xxpn">{102}</span>
decayed,” owing to the competition of “the people of the
adjacent parts,” who were therefore by this monopoly
forbidden to make any sort of rope. The only result of
this measure, however, was to transfer the rope-making
industry from Dorset to Yorkshire, and Bridport was in
a worse plight than before.</div>

<p>In the same reign (1534), the inhabitants of Worcester,
Evesham, Droitwich, Kidderminster, and Bromsgrove,
then the only towns in Worcestershire, complained that
“divers persons <i>dwelling in the hamlets, thorps, and
villages</i> of the county made all manner of cloths, and
exercised shearing, fulling, and weaving within their own
houses, to the great depopulation of the city and towns.”
A monopoly was granted to the towns, the only result of
which was that they became worse off than before, a
great portion of the local industry being transferred to
Leeds. A little later (1544) the citizens of York complain
of the competition of “sundry evil-disposed persons
and apprentices,” who had “withdrawn themselves out
of the city into the country,” and competed with York
in the manufacture of coverlets and blanketings. York
got a monopoly, but her manufactures gained nothing
thereby. Again, in 1552 Edward VI. enacted that the
manufacture of hats, coverlets, and diapers should be
confined to Norwich and the market towns of Norfolk.
Elizabeth granted numerous <i>trading</i> monopolies&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn33" id="fnanc33">33</a>
for the
sale of special articles, but the monopoly system was
opposed to the new competitive spirit of the age. In
1601 a great many of the most obnoxious were withdrawn,
and by that time few remained imposed upon the
manufacture of goods. The above illustrations, however,
are interesting as showing the growth of manufactures in
all parts of the kingdom, and in rural
districts (cf. p. <a href="#p065" title="go to p. 65">65</a>). <span id="p103" class="xxpn">{103}</span>
They are useful also as glaring instances of the folly of
protective enactments.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc33" id="fn33">33</a>
See note 11<i>a</i>, p. <a href="#p246" title="go to p. 246">246,</a> on Monopolies.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
Our exports of manufactures</h4>—Besides these monopolies
we have ample evidence of the growth of our cloth
manufactures in the statements made by Ludovico
Guicciardini (1523–89), as to our exports to Antwerp.
“It is marvellous,” he says, “to think of the vast quantity
of drapery sent by the English into the Netherlands, being
undoubtedly one year with another above 200,000 pieces
of all kinds, which, at the most moderate rate of 25
crowns per piece, is 5,000,000 crowns, so that these and
other merchandise brought by the English to us, or
carried from us to them, may make the annual amount
to more than 12,000,000 crowns,” which is equivalent
to some £2,400,000. One great cause of our progress in
manufactures was the immigration of persecuted Dutch
and Flemish Protestants, previously mentioned, which
formed so important a feature in the new growth of
manufactures and agriculture in Elizabethan England.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
The Flemish immigration in this reign</h4>—This influx
of foreign manufacturers and workmen began to occur
soon after Elizabeth’s accession, when the death of Mary
had relieved men from the fear of Romish persecution.
A numerous body of Flemings came over in 1561, and
starting from Deal, spread to Sandwich, Rye, and other
parts of Kent. Another body settled in Yarmouth, and
over Norfolk generally. In 1570 there were 4000 natives
of the Netherlands in Norwich alone. And after the sack
of Antwerp in 1585, the immigration largely increased.
The new arrivals introduced or improved many manufactures,
such as those of cutlery, clock-making, hats, and
pottery. But the greatest improvements they made
were in weaving and lace-making. They greatly developed
“every sort of workmanship in
wool and flax.” <span id="p104" class="xxpn">{104}</span>
The lace manufacture was introduced by refugees from
Alençon and Valenciennes into Cranfield (Beds), and from
that town it extended to Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire,
and Northamptonshire; while other immigrants founded
the manufacture of the well-known Honiton lace in
Devon. It is interesting thus to notice how much we
owed to foreign teachers in earlier times, for the reigns
of Edward III., Elizabeth, and later of Charles II. were
all signalized by large influxes of people from the Low
Countries, bringing with them increased skill, and often
considerable capital.</div>

<p>An interesting testimony to the influence of these
refugees is afforded by Harrison in his <i>Description of
England</i> (in the time of Elizabeth). He says about our
wool: “In time past the use of this commodity consisted
for the most part in cloth and woolsteds; but now, <i>by
means of strangers succoured here from domestic persecution</i>,
the same hath been employed unto sundry other uses;
as mockados, bays, vellures, grograines, &amp;c., whereby the
makers have reaped no small commodity.”</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Agriculture</h4>—The growth of our manufactures
helped of course to promote sheep farming, not only on
the part of great land-owners, but even of ordinary
moderate farmers. Upon this point also Harrison
mentions an important fact: “And there is never an
husbandman (for now I speak not of our great sheep-masters,
of whom some one man hath 20,000) but hath
more or less of this cattle (sheep) feeding on his fallows
and short grounds, which yield the finer fleece.” Besides
sheep farming, however, which had long since risen into
importance, our agriculture had improved in several
respects. Here foreign influence is again visible. Already
a change in the mode of cultivation had been
brought about, not so great as that which
took place in <span id="p105" class="xxpn">{105}</span>
the two succeeding centuries, but still quite perceptible.
A larger capital was brought to bear upon the land, the
breed of horses and cattle was improved, and more
intelligent use was made of manure and dressings. It
was said that one acre under the new system produced
as much as two did under the old. In addition to these
improvements, the coming of the Flemings and Dutch
introduced several new vegetables. The refugees cultivated
in their gardens, carrots, celery, and cabbages,
which were previously either unknown or very scarce in
this country. The most important service to agriculture,
however, was the introduction of the hop, which is said
to have been brought to England by some Flemish, as
early as 1524, and later in the century, in Elizabeth’s
reign, the hop-gardens of Kent had already become
famous, and have remained so ever since. The introduction
of hops of course led the way to a better method
of brewing beer, and from this time forward beer became
a national beverage.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn34" id="fnanc34">34</a></div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc34" id="fn34">34</a>
The malt liquor, of course, had been in general use at a much
earlier period.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
Social comforts</h4>—All this increase of the national
wealth, in commerce, manufactures, and agriculture, produced
important changes in the mode of living. The
standard of comfort became higher. Food became more
wholesome. As agriculture improved, and animals could
be kept through the winter with greater ease, salt meat
and salt fish no longer formed the staple food of the lower
classes for half the year. Brickmaking had been rediscovered
about 1450; and by the time of Elizabeth the
wooden, or wattled houses (p. <a href="#p019" title="go to p. 19">19</a>) had generally been
replaced, at least among all but the poorest class, with
dwellings of brick and stone. The introduction of
chimneys and the lavish use of glass
also helped to <span id="p106" class="xxpn">{106}</span>
improve the people’s dwellings; and indeed the houses of
the rich merchants, or the lords of the manors, were now
quite luxuriously furnished. Carpets had superseded the
old filthy flooring of rushes; pillows and cushions were
found in all decent houses; and the quantity of carved
woodwork of this period shows that men cared for something
more than mere utility in their surroundings. The
lavishness of new wealth was seen, too, in a certain
love of display, of colour, of “purple and fine linen,”
which characterizes the dress of the Elizabethan age.
The old sober life and thought of mediæval England had
been entirely revolutionized by the sudden opening of
the almost fabulous glories of the New World, and men
revelled joyously in the new prospects of the wealth of
the wondrous West. But yet there were the seeds of
pauperism in the land, and all the wealth of the merchants
and the adventurers of Elizabethan England did
not prevent the sure and inevitable Nemesis that followed
upon the crimes and follies of Elizabeth’s father.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
The condition of the labourers</h4>—For it is impossible,
in glancing at the condition of labour in the days
of Elizabeth, to forget the disastrous economic changes
wrought by the criminal follies of Henry VIII. and his
followers since the earlier days of the fifteenth century.
Compared with the fifteenth century, the poverty of the
wage-earners in Elizabeth’s reign was great indeed,
though even then not so bad as it subsequently became.
But the whole of the next two centuries show a steady
deterioration in the lot of the English labourer and
artisan. Of course the condition of labour will be best
seen by taking examples of the wages then given. In
Elizabeth’s reign, then, we may reckon the yearly wages
of an agricultural labourer at about £8, 4<i>s.</i>, and the cost
of living, which now included
house rent, formerly <span id="p107" class="xxpn">{107}</span>
unknown, at £8, thus leaving a very narrow margin for
contingencies. Daily wages were (in 1564)—for artisans,
8<i>d.</i> a day in winter and 9<i>d.</i> in summer; for labourers,
6<i>d.</i> in winter and 7<i>d.</i> in summer, and in harvest-time
occasionally 8<i>d.</i> or even 10<i>d.</i> This is not very much more
than the wages paid at the close of the fifteenth century
(viz. artisans 3<i>s.</i> a week, and labourers 2<i>s.</i>), but the price
of food had risen almost to three times the old average.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 9.</span>
Assessment of wages by justices. The first Poor
Law</h4>—Wages in husbandry and in handicrafts were now
fixed, under the statute 5 Elizabeth, cap. 4 (1563),&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn35" id="fnanc35">35</a>
by
the justices in quarter sessions, and of course these
employers of labour would hardly fix an unnecessarily
high rate of wages; and, what is more, wages did actually
conform to their assessments in spite of the continual
rise in the price of the necessaries of life. It is not surprising
that under these conditions the problem of
pauperism in England speedily took a very pronounced
form. Even in 1541, under Henry VIII., it was found
that some system of relief was necessary; but a system
of voluntary contributions was for a time sufficient to
meet the difficulty. But in Edward VI.’s reign pauperism
began to increase alarmingly, though now we see that it
was only natural; and finally Elizabeth found it necessary
to institute a regular system of poor-law relief.
In 1601, therefore, by Act 43 Elizabeth, cap. 3, it was
legally enacted that all property should be duly assessed
by regular assessors, in order that rates might be levied
for the relief of pauperism. After a few renewals this
law was made permanent in Charles I.’s reign (1641), and
continued legally in force till 1812; and its general
principles lasted till 1835. The effect of
this poor law <span id="p108" class="xxpn">{108}</span>
was to keep the wages of labour at the very lowest
possible level, for now the employers (chiefly, at that
time, the land-owners) knew that if a labourer’s wages
could not maintain him, he would have to be relieved
from the rates. In other words, part of the labourers’
wages would be, and was, paid by the general public, and
thus expense would be saved to individual employers.
This state of things did not, perhaps, ensue immediately
upon the passing of this law, but became more common
later. The results of the system were seen more clearly
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, to which
we shall subsequently refer.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn36" id="fnanc36">36</a></div>

<div class="dftnt">

Commonly known as the <i>Act of Apprenticeship</i> (cf. note 12,

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 10.</span>
Population</h4>—The marked improvement in agriculture
and the increase of wealth brought with them, at the
close of the sixteenth century, an equally marked increase
of population. We saw that at the time of Domesday the
population of England was under two millions. When
the poll-tax of 1377 was levied, in the last year of Edward
III.’s reign, it had not much increased, being at most not
more than two and a quarter millions, according to careful
calculations based upon the returns of this tax. But
by the end of Elizabeth’s reign it had rapidly risen to
some 5,000,000 souls, at which figure it remained for some
hundred and fifty years longer. The bulk of the population
was still in the southern half of the country,
although the north was now becoming more prosperous,
owing to the extension of manufactures. It will be seen
that England was by no means overcrowded, and yet
people were found who complained of the increase of
population. William Harrison in his <i>Description of
England</i> (written between 1577–87) remarks: “Some
also do grudge at the great increase of people in these
days, thinking a necessary brood of cattle
far better than <span id="p109" class="xxpn">{109}</span>
a superfluous augmentation of mankind. But,” he adds
severely, “I can liken such men best unto the Pope or
the Devil,” and adds that in case of invasion they will
find “that a wall of men is far better than stacks of corn
and bags of money.” Even without the fear of invasion
before our eyes, it is well for us to-day not to forget this
latter sentence in the modern international race for
wealth.</div>

<div class="section padtopb">
<h3>CHAPTER IV
<span class="hsmall">
PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURE IN THE SEVENTEENTH AND
EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
Résumé of progress since thirteenth century</h4>—It
will be remembered that great agricultural changes had
taken place since Henry III.’s reign. For a century or so
after his death (1272) the land-owner was also a cultivator,
living upon his land and owning a large amount of
capital in the form of stock, which he let out under the
stock and land lease system. But after the Great
Plague (1348) this method of cultivation by capitalist
land-owners ceased, except in the one case of sheep
farming; the land-owner became generally a mere rent
receiver; and agriculture consequently suffered. Marling,
for instance, fell into disuse, and the breed of sheep,
it is said, deteriorated somewhat. The great feature of
the change was the transformation of large tracts of
arable land into pasture for sheep, and the growth of
enclosures for the sake of the same animal. The landlords
rapidly proceeded to raise their rents, till, in the
sixteenth century, extortionate renting became so
common that Bishop Latimer,
and Fitzherbert, the <span id="p110" class="xxpn">{110}</span>
author of a useful work on surveying, complained about
it both in sermons and other writings. Hence English
agriculture did not materially improve between the days
of Henry III. and of Elizabeth. But in this queen’s
reign, as we saw, several improvements were made under
the influence of foreign refugees. For the inhabitants of
the Low Countries and Holland have been our pioneers
not only in commerce and finance, but in agriculture also.
It was now these people who introduced into England
the cultivation of artificial grasses and of winter roots,
the want of which, it will be remembered, greatly embarrassed
the English farmer in the mediæval winter. The
introduction of hops also was of great importance.</div>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Progress in James I.’s reign. Influence of landlords</h4>—Of
course the greatest industrial progress of this
period was made in the direction of foreign trade, and in
James’s reign progress in agriculture was slow as compared
with that in commerce, but it was substantial—substantial
enough, at any rate, for the landlords to exact
an increased competitive rent, as we know from Norden’s
work, <i>The Surveyor’s Dialogue</i> (1607). It was even complained
that the actions of the landlords tended to discourage
progress, for when a tenant wished to renew a
lease he was threatened with dispossession if he did not
pay an increased rent for the very improvements he had
made himself. However, from the facts given by Norden,
and also by another writer—Markham, the author of
<i>The English Husbandman</i> (1613)—it is evident that there
was considerable improvement, development, and variety
now shown in English agriculture. The special characteristic
feature of the seventeenth century is the utilization
of the fallow for roots, though these had been known
in gardens in the previous century. Land was still
largely cultivated in common fields, and
was, of course, <span id="p111" class="xxpn">{111}</span>
much subdivided. The most fertile land was to be found
in Huntingdon, Bedford, and Cambridge shires, the next
best being in Northampton, Kent, Essex, Berkshire, and
Hertfordshire.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Writers on agriculture. Improvements. Game</h4>—Oxen
were still preferred to horses; but a noticeable
improvement is the attention now paid to the various
kinds of manures, on which subject Markham was the
first to write specially. The fact that agriculture was
now made the topic of various treatises proves that important
development was taking place. Besides the works
already mentioned, we have the <i>Systema Agriculturæ</i> by
Worridge, a farmer of Hampshire, the second edition of
which appeared in 1675. He is a strong advocate of
enclosures, as against the old common field system, on
the plea that the former is more conducive to high farming;
but he also is in favour of small enclosed farms.
Though at first local and somewhat spasmodic, and
hindered by the landlord’s power of appropriating the
results of increased skill on the part of the tenant, under
the head of “indestructible powers of the soil,” yet the
progress made was sufficient to double the population of
England. A curious fact in the agriculture of the seventeenth
century may be here mentioned; I mean the
existence of a very large amount of waste land, and the
use made of it for purposes of breeding game. At that
time it is evident that killing game was not the exclusive
right of the land-owners, but was a common privilege.
Large quantities of game were sold, and at a cheap price,
and “fowling” must evidently have been an important
item in the farmer’s means of livelihood.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
Drainage of the fens</h4>—A most important feature in
the development of agriculture in the Eastern counties
was the drainage of the fens—<i>i.e.</i> all
that large district <span id="p112" class="xxpn">{112}</span>
which extends inward from the Wash into the counties of
Lincoln, Cambridge, Northampton, Huntingdon, Norfolk
and Suffolk. This district had been reclaimed by the
Romans, and had been then a fertile country. But in
the time of the Domesday Book it was once again a mere
marsh, owing to incursions of the sea, which the English
at that time had not the ability to prevent. Although even
in 1436, and subsequently, partial attempts had been
made to reclaim this vast area, the first effectual effort was
begun only in 1634, by the Earl of Bedford, who got 95,000
acres of the reclaimed land as a reward for his undertaking.
The contract was fulfilled in 1649, and a corporation
was formed to manage the “Bedford level,” as it was
now called, in 1688. The reclaiming of so much land
naturally increased the prosperity of the counties in which
it stood, and their agriculture flourished considerably in
consequence, Bedfordshire for instance being now the
most exclusively agricultural county in the kingdom.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
Rise of price of corn, and of rent</h4>—The price of corn,
meanwhile, was now steadily rising. From 1401 to
1540—<i>i.e.</i> before the rise in prices and the debasement of
the coinages—the average price had been six shillings per
quarter; after prices had recovered from their inflation
and settled down to a general average once more, taking
the price from 1603 to 1702, corn was forty-one shillings
per quarter. The average produce had apparently
declined since the fifteenth and before the improvements
of the seventeenth century. In the former period it was
about twelve bushels per acre, and in the fourteenth
century eleven bushels; but Gregory King, writing in
the seventeenth century, only gives ten bushels as the
average of his time. His estimate, however, is doubted.
At the same time, rent had risen from the sixpence per
acre of the fifteenth century to
four shillings, according <span id="p113" class="xxpn">{113}</span>
to Professor Rogers, or even 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> according to King,
who says the gains of the farmer of his time are very small,
and that rents were more than doubled between 1600 and
1699. We will reserve the topic of the rise of rent,
however, for a separate section, and keep to the agricultural
developments of the period.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Special features of the eighteenth century. Popularity
of agriculture</h4>—As the use of winter roots had been
the special feature of the seventeenth century, so the
feature of the eighteenth was the extension of artificial
pasture and the increased use of clover, sainfoin, and rye-grass;
not, of course, that these had been hitherto unknown,
but now their seeds are regularly bought and used
by any farmer who knew his business. At first, like all
other processes of agriculture, the development was very
slow and gradual, but it went on steadily nevertheless.
A great stimulus to progress was given by the fact that
the English gentlemen of the eighteenth century developed
quite a passion for agriculture as a hobby, and
it became a fashionable pursuit for all people of any
means, citizens and professional men joining in it as a
kind of bye-industry, as well as farmers and land-owners
who made it their business. Arthur Young, the great
agricultural writer of this century, declares that “the
farming tribe is now made up of all classes, from a duke
to an apprentice.” But two important mistakes were
made in the eighteenth century, and they have not
ceased to exist in the nineteenth, causing very largely the
distress under which English agriculture has for some
time been labouring. They are the mistakes of occupying
too much land with insufficient capital, and of not
keeping regular and detailed accounts. Still, between
1720 and 1760, progress was very rapid, and noble land-owners
made great efforts to improve
their estates, in <span id="p114" class="xxpn">{114}</span>
order thereby to raise their rents and increase their
profits, in the hope of outdoing the great merchant
princes who had now appeared upon the scene. They
thus became in a way the pioneers of agricultural progress,
the principal result of their efforts being seen
in the increased number and quality of the stock now
kept on farms.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
Improvements of cattle, and in the productiveness
of land. Statistics</h4>—The extended cultivation of winter
roots, clover, and other grasses, naturally made it far
easier for the farmer to feed his animals in the winter;
and the improvement in stock followed closely upon the
improvement in fodder. The abundance of stock, too,
had again a beneficial result in the increased qualities
of manure produced, and the utilization of this fertilizer
was scientifically developed. The useful, though costly,
process of marling was again revived, and was advocated
by Arthur Young; soils were also treated with clay,
chalk, or lime. So great was the improvement thus made,
that the productiveness of land in the eighteenth century
rose to four times that of the thirteenth century, when
five bushels or eight bushels of corn per acre was the
average. Stock, also, was similarly improved; an
eighteenth century fatted ox often weighed 1200 lbs.,
while hitherto, from the fourteenth to the end of the seventeenth
century, the weight had not been usually much
above 400 lbs. The weight of the fleece of sheep had also
increased quite four times. Population being even then
small, a considerable quantity of corn was exported, the
British farmer being also protected from foreign competition
by the corn laws (made in Charles II.’s reign,
1661 and 1664), forbidding importation of corn, except
when it rose to famine prices. Young estimated the
acreage of the country at 32,000,000 acres
(King put it <span id="p115" class="xxpn">{115}</span>
at 22,000,000 in the seventeenth century); its value (at
thirty-three and one-half years’ purchase) was, says
Young, £536,000,000. The value of stock he places at
nearly £110,000,000, and estimates the wheat and rye
crop at over 9,000,000 quarters per annum, barley at
11,500,000 quarters, and oats at 10,250,000 quarters.
The rent of land had risen to nearly ten shillings
an acre.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
Wrong done to small land-owners by the Statute
of Frauds</h4>—The development and success of English
agriculture, from 1700 to 1765 or 1770, was thus remarkable
and extensive; but it was not effected without considerable
economic changes and great and unnecessary
suffering among two important classes of the population—the
yeomen or small freeholders, and the agricultural
labourers. The decay of the yeomanry, indeed, forms
a sad interlude in the growing prosperity of the country.
The position of many small land-owners had been greatly
and disastrously affected by the Statute of Frauds,
passed in the time of Charles II. By this extraordinary
and high-handed Act it was decreed that after July 24th,
1677, all interests in land whatsoever, if created by any
other process except by deed, should be treated as
tenancies at will only, any law or usage to the contrary
notwithstanding. The intention, apparently, of those
who passed this law—an intention which resulted successfully—was
to extinguish all those numerous small
freeholders who had no written evidence to prove that
they held their lands, as they had done for centuries,
on condition of paying a small fixed and customary rent.
This Act certainly succeeded in dispossessing many of
the class at which it was aimed; but there were yet a
certain number against whom it was inoperative; hence,
at the end of the seventeenth century, twenty
years or so <span id="p116" class="xxpn">{116}</span>
after this Act, Gregory King is able to estimate that
there were 180,000 freeholders in England, including, of
course, the larger owners. But by the time of Arthur
Young these also had disappeared, or at least were
rapidly disappearing, and he sincerely regrets “to see
their lands now in the hands of monopolizing lords.”</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 9.</span>
Causes of the decay of the yeomanry</h4>—The cause
was partly political and partly social. After the revolution
of 1688, the landed gentry became politically and
socially supreme, and any successful merchant prince—and
these were not few—who wished to gain a footing
sought, in the first place, to imitate them by becoming
a great land-owner; hence it became quite a policy to
buy out the smaller farmers, and they were often
practically compelled to sell their holdings. At the same
time, the custom of primogeniture and strict settlements
prevented land from being much subdivided, so that small
or divided estates never came into the market for the
smaller freeholders to buy. It is also certain that this
result was accelerated by the fact that small farms no
longer paid under the old system of agriculture, and the
new system involved an outlay that the yeoman could not
afford. Farming on a large scale became more necessary,
and this again assisted in extinguishing the smaller
men, for large enclosures were made by the landed gentry
in spite of feeble opposition from the yeomen, who,
however, could rarely afford to pay the law costs necessary
to put a stop to the encroachments of their greater
neighbours. Thus the yeomen lost their rights in the
common lands, and at the same time the new agriculture
involved a breaking up of the old common field
system, which could not possibly hold its own against the
modern improvements.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 10.</span>
Great increase of
enclosures</h4>—The abolition of <span id="p117" class="xxpn">{117}</span>
the old system was necessary, but the manner in which it
was carried out was disastrous. The enclosures of the
landed gentry were often carried on with little regard to
the interests of the smaller tenants and freeholders, who,
in fact, suffered greatly; and in this present age English
agriculture is, in a large measure, still feeling the subsequent
effects of the change, while many people are
advocating a partial return to small holdings, cultivated,
however, with the improved experience given by modern
agricultural progress. Apparently, this was not the first
occasion on which the land-owners had made enclosures
and encroached upon the common lands of their poorer
neighbours, and not merely upon the waste; but the
rapidity and boldness of the enclosing operations in the
eighteenth century far surpassed anything in previous
times. Between 1710 and 1760, for instance, 334,974
acres were enclosed; and between 1760 and 1843 the
number rose to 7,000,000.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 11.</span>
Benefits of enclosures as compared with the old
common fields</h4>—The benefits of the enclosure system
were, however, unmistakable, for the cultivation of
common fields under the old system was, as Arthur
Young assures us, miserably poor. The arable land of
each village under this system was still divided into three
great strips, subdivided by “baulks” three yards wide.
Every farmer would own one piece of land in each strip—probably
more—and all alike were bound to follow the
customary tillage; this was to leave one strip fallow
every year, while on one of the other two wheat was
always grown, the third being occupied by barley or oats,
pease, or tares. The meadows, also, were still held in
common, every man having his own plot up to hay
harvest, after which the fences were thrown down, and
all householders’ cattle were allowed to graze
on it freely, <span id="p118" class="xxpn">{118}</span>
while for the next crop the plots were redistributed.
Every farmer also had the right of pasture on the waste.
This system produced results miserably inferior to those
gained on enclosed lands, the crop of wheat in one instance
being, according to Young, only seventeen or
eighteen bushels per acre, as against twenty-six bushels
on enclosures. Similarly, the fleece of sheep pastured
on common fields weighed only 3&#x2060;½ lbs., as compared with
9 lbs. on enclosures. It is noticeable, too, that Kent,
where much land had for a long time been enclosed and
cultivated, was reckoned in Young’s time the best cultivated
and most fertile county in England. Norfolk,
also, was pre-eminent for good husbandry, in its excellent
rotation of crops and culture of clover, rye-grass, and
winter roots, due, said Young, in 1770, “to the division
of the county chiefly into large farms,” and, it must be
added, to unscrupulous enclosure.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 12.</span>
The rise in rent</h4>—The farmer himself, however,
was heavily taxed for his land, and though the high prices
he got for his corn up to the repeal of the corn laws
enabled him to pay it, his rent was certainly at a very
high figure. The rise had begun after the dissolution of
the monasteries in the sixteenth century, though in that
period the rise was slow. But Latimer asserts that his
father only paid £3 or £4 for a holding which in the next
generation was rented at £16, the increased figure being
only partially accounted for by the general rise in prices.
In the seventeenth century, according to King, rents were
more than doubled, and the sixpence per acre of mediæval
times must have seemed almost mythical. The Belvoir
estate, the property of the Dukes of Rutland, who are
spoken of as indulgent landlords, forms a good example
of the rise of rent in the two following centuries. In
1692 land is found rented at <span class="nowrap">3<i>s.</i> 9&#x2060;¼<i>d.</i></span> an acre,
and a little <span id="p119" class="xxpn">{119}</span>
later at <span class="nowrap">4<i>s.</i> 1&#x2060;½<i>d.</i></span> By the year 1799 the same land had
risen to <span class="nowrap">19<i>s.</i> 3&#x2060;¾<i>d.</i>,</span>
with a further rise in 1812 to <span class="nowrap">25<i>s.</i> 8&#x2060;¾<i>d.</i></span>
In 1830 it was at <span class="nowrap">25<i>s.</i> 1&#x2060;¾<i>d.</i>,</span>
but in 1850 had risen to
<span class="nowrap">38<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,</span>
that is about ten times the seventeenth century
rent. This enormous rise was not by any means due
solely to increase of skill in agricultural industry, but
was largely derived from increased economy in production,
or, in other words, from the oppression and degradation
of the agricultural labourer.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 13.</span>
The fall in wages</h4>—This degradation was brought
about by the system of assessment&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn37" id="fnanc37">37</a>
of wages which we
noticed in Elizabeth’s reign, a system by which the
labourer was forced by law to accept the wages which the
justices (generally the landed proprietors, his employers)
arranged to give him. It is not the business of an historian
to make charges against a class, but to put facts
in their due perspective. Therefore without comment
upon the action of the justices in this matter I shall
merely refer to one or two of these assessments and show
their effect upon the condition of labour, especially of
agricultural labour, which occupied more than one-third
of the working classes. Speaking generally, we may
quote Professor Rogers’ remark, that “if we suppose the
ordinary labourer to get <span class="nowrap">3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></span> a week throughout the
year, by adding his harvest allowance to his winter
wages, it would have taken him more than forty weeks
to earn the provisions which in 1495 he could have got
with fifteen weeks’ labour, while the artisan would be
obliged to have given thirty-two weeks’ work for the
same result.” To give details, we may first quote, as an
example, the Rutland magistrates’ assessment, in April
1610. The wages of an ordinary
agricultural labourer <span id="p120" class="xxpn">{120}</span>
are put at 7<i>d.</i> a day from Easter to Michaelmas, and at
6<i>d.</i> from Michaelmas to Easter. Artisans get 10<i>d.</i> or 9<i>d.</i>
in summer, and 8<i>d.</i> in winter. Now, the price of food
was 75 per cent. dearer than in 1564, while the rate of
wages are about the same; and compared with (say)
1495, food was three, or even four, times dearer. Another
assessment, in Essex in 1661, allows 1<i>s.</i> a day in winter,
and <span class="nowrap">1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i></span> in summer, for ordinary labour. But, in 1661,
the price of wheat
<span class="nowrap">(70<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></span> a quarter) was just double
the price of 1610 <span class="nowrap">(35<i>s.</i> 2&#x2060;½<i>d.</i>).</span>
The labourer was worse
off than ever. Another typical assessment is that of
Warwick, in 1684, when wages of labourers are fixed at
8<i>d.</i> a day in summer, 7<i>d.</i> in winter; of artisans at 1<i>s.</i> a
day. At this period Professor Rogers reckons the yearly
earnings of an artisan at <span class="nowrap">£15, 13<i>s.</i>;</span> of a farm labourer
at <span class="nowrap">£10, 8<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,</span> exclusive of harvest work; while the cost
of a year’s stock of provisions was <span class="nowrap">£14, 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></span> It is true
that at this period the labourer still possessed certain
advantages, such as common rights, which, besides
providing fuel, enabled them to keep cows and pigs and
poultry on the waste. Their cottages, too, were often
rent free, being built upon the waste, while each cottage,
by the Act of Elizabeth, was supposed to have a piece of
land attached to it, though this provision was frequently
evaded. But yet it is evident that, even allowing for
these privileges, which, after all, were now being rapidly
curtailed, the ordinary agricultural labourer—that is,
the mass of the wage-earning population—must have
found it hard work to live decently. By the beginning
of the eighteenth century his condition had sunk to one
of great poverty. The ordinary peasant, in 1725, for
instance, would not earn more than £13 or about £15 a
year; artisans could not gain more than <span class="nowrap">£15, 13<i>s.</i>;</span> while
the cost of the stock of provisions was £16,
<span class="nowrap">2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i></span> Thus <span id="p121" class="xxpn">{121}</span>
the husbandman who, in 1495, could get a similar stock
of food by fifteen weeks’ work, and the artisan who could
have earned it in ten weeks, could not feed himself in
1725 with a whole year’s labour. His wages had to be
supplemented out of the rates; and there was but little
alteration in these rates till the middle of the eighteenth
century. But about that time (1750) he had begun to
share in the general prosperity caused by the success of
the new agriculture and the growth of trade and manufactures.
The evil, however, had been done, and although
a short period of prosperity, chiefly due to the
advance made by the new agriculture, cheered the
labourer for a time, his condition after the Industrial
Revolution again rapidly deteriorated, till we find him
at the end of the eighteenth century and for some time
afterwards in a condition of chronic misery.</div>

<span class="hsmall">
COMMERCE AND WAR IN THE SEVENTEENTH AND
EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
England a commercial power</h4>—In glancing over
the progress of foreign trade in the time of Elizabeth, we
noticed that our war with Spain was due to commercial as
well as religious causes. The opening up of the New
World made a struggle for power in the West almost
inevitable among European nations; the new route to
India <i>viâ</i> the Cape of Good Hope, discovered by Vasco da
Gama, made another struggle for commercial supremacy
as inevitable in the far East. In the reign of Henry VIII.
we find, from one of his Statutes, that
Malaga had been <span id="p122" class="xxpn">{122}</span>
the farthest port to which at this time English seamen yet
ventured. For a century or more after the discoveries
of Columbus and da Gama, Spain and Portugal, and a
little later on Holland, had practically a monopoly both
of the Eastern and Western trade. But now a change
had come. The Englishmen of the Elizabethan age cast
off their fear of Spain, entered into rivalry with Holland,
and finally made England the supreme commercial power
of the modern world. The history of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries is a continuous record of their
struggles to attain this object.</div>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
The beginnings of the struggle with Spain</h4>—In the
last quarter of the sixteenth century Elizabeth had
entered (1579) into an alliance, offensive and defensive,
with Holland against Spain. The motive of the alliance
was partly religious, but the shrewdness of the queen and
her statesmen no doubt foresaw more than spiritual
advantages to be gained thereby. After the alliance,
Drake and the other great naval captains of that day
began a system of buccaneering annoyances to Spanish
commerce. The Spanish and Portuguese trade and
factories in the East were considered the lawful prizes
of the English and their allies the Dutch. The latter,
as all know, were more successful at first than we were,
and soon established an Oriental Empire in the Indian
Archipelago. But at the very end of her reign England
had prospered sufficiently for Elizabeth to grant charters
to the Levant Company, and its far greater companion
the East India Company. Then, when a fresh war with
Spain was imminent, England wisely began to plant
colonies in North America, at the suggestion of Sir Walter
Raleigh; and after one or two other abortive attempts,
Virginia was successfully founded by the London Company
in 1609, and became a Crown
colony in 1624. <span id="p123" class="xxpn">{123}</span>
After this, as every one knows, colonies grew rapidly on
the strip of coast between the Alleghany Mountains and
the Atlantic. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world
the East India Company was slowly gaining ground, and
founding English agencies or “factories,” that of Surat
(in 1612) being the most important. As yet we had not
come into open conflict with Spain or Portugal; and
indeed we owed the possession of Bombay to the marriage
of Charles II. with Katherine of Braganza (1661). Then
the company gained from Charles II. the important
privilege of making peace or war on their own account.
It had a good many foes to contend with, both among
natives and European nations, among whom the French
were as powerful as the Portuguese.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Cromwell’s commercial wars</h4>—The monopoly of
Spain was first really attacked by Cromwell. James I.
had been too timid to declare war, and Charles I. was too
much in danger himself to think of trusting his subjects
to support him if he did so. But Cromwell was supported
both by the religious views of the Puritans and the desires
of the merchants when he declared war against England’s
great foe. He demanded trade with the Spanish colonies,
and religious freedom for English settlers in such colonies.
Of course his demands were refused, as he well knew that
they would be. Whereupon he seized Jamaica (1655)
and intended to secure Cuba; and at any rate succeeded
in giving the English a secure footing in the West Indies.
He seized Dunkirk also from Spain (then at war with
France), with a view to securing England a monopoly of
the Channel to the exclusion of our old friends the Dutch.
Dunkirk, however, was a useless acquisition, and was
sold again by Charles II. Not content with victory in
the West, Cromwell with the full consent of mercantile
England declared war against the Dutch,
who were now <span id="p124" class="xxpn">{124}</span>
more our rivals than our friends. It would have been
perfectly possible for the English and the Dutch to have
remained upon good terms; but the great idea of the
statesmen and merchants of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries was to gain a sole market and a monopoly
of trade, and so the Dutch had to be crushed. It was a
mistake, but mistakes have frequently been made, owing
to a lack of that indispensable concomitant of statesmanship,
accurate economic knowledge. Cromwell succeeded
in his object. He defeated the Dutch and broke
their prestige in the two years’ war of 1652–54, and designed
to ruin their trade by the Navigation Acts of 1651
(p. <a href="#p130" title="go to p. 130">130</a>). The contest between the Dutch and English
for the mastery of the seas was already practically
decided, and the capture of New Amsterdam (New York
as we called it afterwards) in 1664, and the subsequent
wars of Charles II.’s reign, completed the discomfiture
of Holland.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The wars of William III. and of Anne</h4>—The continental
wars in which England was engaged after the
deposition of James II. were rendered necessary to some
extent by the tremendous power of France under Louis
XIV. William III. saw it was inevitable for the interest
of England that Louis XIV. should be checked, and the
war of the Spanish Succession (1702–13) was carried on
with the object of preventing that king from joining the
resources of Spain to those of his own kingdom. For had
he done so two disastrous results would have happened.
The Stuarts would by his help have been restored to
the English throne, and the struggle against absolute
monarchy and religious tyranny would unfortunately
have been fought over again. Secondly, the growth of
English commerce would have been checked if not utterly
annihilated. As it was we were
preserved from the <span id="p125" class="xxpn">{125}</span>
Stuarts; and when the war was finally over in 1713,
found ourselves in possession of Gibraltar, now one of the
keys of our Indian Empire, and of the Hudson’s Bay
Territory, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia (then called
Acadia)—the foundations of our present Canadian
dominion. England was also allowed by Spain to trade—in
negroes—with Spanish colonies, and to send one
ship a year to the South Seas. The war, as far as we
were concerned, was a commercial success, though we
had to pay rather heavily for it, and were involved in
further difficulties in America thereby.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
Expansion of English trade after these wars</h4>&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn38" id="fnanc38">38</a>—Even
during the above wars English trade had been
spreading. English merchants now did business in the
Mediterranean with Turkey and Italy, in the North with
Holland, Germany, Russia and Norway, in the East with
India, Arabia and Africa, in the West with America and
the Spanish colonies. Many companies were started, too
numerous to mention here, for those who had hoarded
their money during the war were now anxious to make
profitable use of it. Of these new companies the most
famous was the South Sea Company, formed in 1711 to
trade with South America. The directors anticipated
enormous profits, and offered to advance the Government
£7,500,000 to pay off part of the National Debt. Everyone
knows the story of their collapse (1721), and the
ruin it brought upon thousands of worthy but credulous
shareholders. It was a time when all the accumulated
capital of the country seemed to run riot in hopes of
gaining profits. Hundreds of smaller companies were
started every day, and an unhealthy excitement prevailed.
One company, with a capital
of £3,000,000, was <span id="p126" class="xxpn">{126}</span>
started “for insuring to all masters and mistresses the
losses they may sustain by servants”; another “for
making salt-water fresh”; a third for “planting mulberry
trees and breeding silk-worms in Chelsea Park.”
One in particular was designed for importing “a number
of large jackasses from Spain in order to propagate a
larger kind of mule in England,” as if, remarks a later
writer with some severity, there were not already jackasses
enough in London alone.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc38" id="fn38">38</a>
See note 16, p. <a href="#p249" title="go to p. 249">249,</a> on Union with Scotland, Darien Scheme
and Methuen Treaty.</p></div>

<p>All this mania for investing capital, however, shows
how prosperous England had now become, and how great
a quantity of wealth had been accumulated, partly by
trade, but also by the growth of manufactures and improvements
in agriculture. Englishmen now felt strong
enough to have another struggle for the monopoly of
trade, with the result that fresh wars were undertaken,
and the country was heavily burdened with debt. But
the wars were on the whole a success, though the wish for
a monopoly was a mistake.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Further wars with France and Spain</h4>—All the
wars in which England now engaged had some commercial
object in view. People had yet to learn that the best way
to extend a nation’s trade is to promote general peace.
In default of that, however, it seemed well to provoke a
general war. Mistaken as England’s policy was, it was no
more so than that of her neighbours, for all believed, as
many do still, in the sole market theory. Moreover,
England was provoked into war by the secret “Family
Compact” between the related rulers of France and
Spain, by which Philip V. of Spain agreed to take away
the South American trade from England, and give it to
his nephew, Louis XV. of France. The result was a
system of annoyance to English vessels trading in the
South Seas, culminating in the mutilation
of an English <span id="p127" class="xxpn">{127}</span>
captain, one Jenkins, and war was declared openly in
1739. This war merged into the war of the Austrian
Succession, which lasted for eight years (1740–48), a
matter with which England was in no way concerned,
but which afforded a good excuse to renew the struggle
against the commercial growth of France as well as Spain.
We gained nothing by it except the final annihilation of
the hopes of the Stuarts, and a small increase of British
power upon the high seas.</div>

<p>After a few years, however, we entered upon another
war, the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), in which England
and Prussia fought side by side against the rest of
Europe, and attacked France in particular in all parts of
the world. The war was largely caused by the quarrels
of the French and English colonists in America, and of
rival traders in India. We cannot here go into the details
of it. It is sufficient to say that, after a bad beginning,
we won various victories by sea and land, and at the close
(1763) found ourselves in possession of Canada, Florida,
and all the French possessions east of the Mississippi
except New Orleans, and had gained the upper hand in
India. We held almost undisputed sway over the seas,
and our trade grew by leaps and bounds. Unfortunately
we afterwards engaged in other wars of a less necessary
character, and wasted a great deal of our wealth before
the end of the century. But the short peace which
ensued after 1763 gave us an opportunity which we did
not neglect of increasing our national industries, and
practically gave us the great start in manufactures to
which we owe our present wealth. In this war, too, we
gained our Indian Empire and Canada, to which we must
devote a few short remarks.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
The struggle for India</h4>—Since the founding of
Surat and the acquisition of Bombay,
the East India <span id="p128" class="xxpn">{128}</span>
Company had also founded two forts or stations, which
have since become most important cities, namely, Fort
St George in 1640 (now Madras), and Fort William in
1698 (now Calcutta). They had become powerful, and
each of the three chief stations had a governor and a
small army. The French, however, had also an East
India Company, whose chief station was Pondicherry,
south of Madras; and the two companies were by no
means on friendly terms. When their respective nations
were at war in 1746–48, they too had some sharp fighting,
but it was only when Dupleix, the French Governor of
Pondicherry, had gained almost absolute power over
Southern India after the death of the Great Mogul and
the Nizam of the Dekkan in 1748, that matters became
serious. The English traders feared with justice the loss
both of their lives and commerce, and open war broke
out. The magnificent exertions of Clive and Lawrence
defeated the French, and finally Dupleix was recalled in
1754 and quiet was restored. But two years afterwards
the Seven Years’ War broke out, and India was disturbed
again. Suraj-ud-Daula, the ally of the French, took Calcutta
and committed the Black Hole atrocity (1757), and
he and his allies did their best to drive the English out
of Bengal. This province, however, was saved by Clive
at the battle of Plassey; Coote defeated the French at
Wondiwash (1760); and Pondicherry was captured by
the English in 1761. Finally in 1765 the East India Company
became the collector of the revenues for Bengal,
Behar, and Orissa, and thus the English power was
acknowledged and consolidated. Our future struggles
in India were not with the French but with native princes.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
The conquest of Canada</h4>—There was, however, a
great struggle for commercial supremacy to be waged
against the French in America. It began
in 1754. The <span id="p129" class="xxpn">{129}</span>
English had now thirteen flourishing colonies between the
Alleghany Mountains and the sea. Behind them, above
them, and below them, all was claimed by France as
French territory. It was inevitable that the growth of
our colonies should lead to war, and such was the case.
The French began by driving out English settlers from
land west of the Alleghany Mountains; the English retorted
by driving French settlers out of Nova Scotia, and
tried to make a colony in the Ohio valley. In this latter
object they were foiled by Duquesne, the French Governor
of Canada, who built Fort Duquesne there in 1754.
Shortly afterwards, the next Governor, Montcalm, conceived
the idea of linking together Forts Duquesne,
Niagara, and Ticonderoga by lesser forts, so as to keep
the English in their narrow strip of eastern coast-line.
Then the English Government at home took up the
matter, and sent out General Braddock and 2000 men to
help the colonists. Braddock was defeated and killed
(1755), but when the Seven Years’ War broke out in the
next year, Pitt sent ammunition, men, and money to
help the colonists to attack Quebec and Montreal. The
war was renewed in Canada with fresh vigour; Fort
Duquesne was captured in 1758, Quebec in 1759, and
Montreal in 1760; and when peace was made in Europe
in 1763, England had gained all the French possessions
in America, and her colonies were enabled to extend as
far as they desired. We foolishly lost them by a mistaken
policy a few years afterwards.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 9.</span>
Survey of commercial progress during these wars</h4>—The
reign of James I. was noticeable for the rapid growth
of the foreign trade which had developed from the somewhat
piratical excursions of the Elizabethan sailors.
Trading companies were formed in considerable numbers,
and among them the Levant Company
may be noticed, <span id="p130" class="xxpn">{130}</span>
as having made “great gains” in the East in 1605. The
mercantile class was now growing both numerous and
powerful, and a proof of their advance in social position
and influence is furnished by the new title of nobility,
that of baronet, conferred by James I. upon such merchant
princes as were able and willing to pay the needy
king a good round sum for the honour.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn39" id="fnanc39">39</a>
It is interesting,
by the way, to notice the figures of trade in his reign. In
1613 the exports and imports both together were about
£4,628,586 in value, and a sign of a quickly developing
Eastern trade is also seen in the fact that James made
attempts to check the increasing export of silver from the
kingdom. At this time English merchants traded with
most of the Mediterranean ports, with Portugal, Spain,
France, Hamburg, and the Baltic coasts. Ships from
the north and west of Europe used in return to visit the
Newcastle collieries, which were rapidly growing in value.
The English ships were also very active in the new cod
fisheries of Newfoundland, and the Greenland whale
fisheries. Commerce was further aided by the Navigation
Acts of 1651, which provided that no merchandise of
Asia, Africa, or America should be imported in any but
English ships. Previously, the carrying trade had been
in the hands of the Dutch, but Holland had now entered
upon the period of its decline, and the short war with
England which followed these Acts contributed to hasten
it. The development of English trade is signalized in this
century by the appearance of numerous books and essays
on commercial questions, of which the works of Mun,
Malynes, Misselden, Roberts, Sir Josiah Child, Worth,
and Davenant may be mentioned as among the most important.
The increase in the wealth of the country is
shown by the rapid rebuilding of London
after the Great <span id="p131" class="xxpn">{131}</span>
Fire, when the loss was estimated at £12,000,000; and
Sir Josiah Child, writing in 1670, speaks of the great development
of the commerce and trade of England in the
previous twenty years. We know from Gregory King
that rents had been doubled in this period, and that is
always a sure sign of prosperity. The East India Company
was so flourishing that in 1676 their stock was
quoted at 245 per cent. Trade with America was
equally prosperous. New Amsterdam, now New York,
was taken from the Dutch in 1664, and in 1670 the Hudson’s
Bay Company received their charter. But the
main commercial fact of the latter half of the seventeenth
century, and of the eighteenth, was the development of
the Eastern trade, and, as a consequence, of the home
production of articles to be exchanged for Eastern goods.
The cloth trade especially was greatly increased, and imports
of cloth from Spain were quite superseded. This
improvement in English manufactures led to increased
trade with our colonial possessions, especially in the West
Indies. It was partly, perhaps, this great development
of English trade&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn40" id="fnanc40">40</a>
with both the Western and the Eastern
markets that stimulated the genius of the great inventors
to supply our manufacturers with machinery that would
enable them to meet the huge demands upon their powers
of production, for, by 1760, the export trade had grown
to many times its value in the days of James I. Then, as
we saw, it was only £2,000,000 per annum; in 1703,
nearly a hundred years later, it was, according to a
MS. of Davenant’s, £6,552,019; by 1760 it reached
£14,500,000. The markets, too, had undergone a change.
We no longer exported so largely to Holland, Portugal,
and France, as in the seventeenth century, but instead
one-third of our exports went to our colonies. In 1770, <span id="p132" class="xxpn">{132}</span>
for example, America took three-fourths of the manufactures
of Manchester, and Jamaica alone took almost
as much of our manufactures as all our plantations together
had done in the beginning of the century. The
prosperity and development of modern English commerce,
as we know it, had now begun. It was due, of
course, not to the great wars we had waged for the right
of a sole market, but to the fact that we were able to
supply the markets of the world with manufactured goods
that no other country could then produce. How we were
able to do so will shortly be seen when we come to speak
of the Industrial Revolution of the last half of the eighteenth
century.</div>

<h3>CHAPTER VI
<span class="hsmall">
MANUFACTURES AND MINING</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
Circumstances favourable to English manufactures</h4>—I
have frequently remarked in previous chapters that
Flanders was the great manufactory of Europe throughout
the Middle Ages, and up to the sixteenth century.
Her competition would in any case have been sufficient to
check much export of manufactured goods from England,
though we had by the sixteenth century got past the time
when most of our imports of clothing came from Flanders.
Now, at the end of the sixteenth century, Flemish competition
was practically annihilated, owing to the ravages
made in the Low Countries by the Spanish persecutions
and occupation. But England did not merely benefit by
the cessation of Flemish competition: she received at the
same time hundreds of Flemish immigrants, who greatly
improved our home manufactures,
and thus our <span id="p133" class="xxpn">{133}</span>
prosperity was doubly assisted. The result is seen in the
fact that our export of wool diminished, and our export
of cloth increased.</div>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span> Wool trade. Home
manufactures. Dyeing</h4>—In the reign of James I. the wool trade is
even said to have declined, and certainly we know that little wool
can have been exported, for nearly all that produced in England was
used for home manufacture. On the other hand, however, the same fact
shows that the manufacturing industry was rising in importance, for it
required all the home-grown wool that could be got; and, in 1660, the
export of British wool was for this reason forbidden, and remained so
till 1825. The woollen trade was now very largely in the hands of the
Merchant Adventurers,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn41" id="fnanc41">41</a>
whose methods caused many complaints; but the manufacturing industry
flourished steadily, and a considerable part of the population was
now engaged in it. It seems to have received some impetus, also,
from the Acts 4 and 5 James I. (1607 and 1608), carefully regulating
and guarding the quality of cloth exported, and by the end of the
seventeenth century no less than two-thirds of our exports were woollen
fabrics. The usefulness of our climate, too, for this particular
manufacture had been discovered, and was now recognized, while the
manufacturing industry was likewise aided by the impetus given to
dyeing by the exertions of Sir Walter Raleigh. Previously to James I.’s
reign most English goods had to be sent to the Netherlands to be dyed,
as I explained above; but Raleigh, in his <i>Essay on Commerce</i>, called
attention to this fact, and proposed to grant a monopoly for the art of
dyeing and <span id="p134" class="xxpn">{134}</span> dressing, and by
his advice the export of English white goods was prohibited (1608), but
the monopoly granted to Sir W. Cockayne caused such an outcry that it
was revoked.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc41" id="fn41">41</a>
This Company, by charters from James I. in 1604 and 1617,
had the exclusive privilege of exporting the woollen cloths of
England to the Netherlands and Germany. It included some
4000 merchants.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Other influences favourable to England. The
Huguenot immigration</h4>—But other influences were at
work in the seventeenth century in favour of our home
industries. It becomes more and more apparent that
our insular position was specially fitted for the development
of manufactures as soon as they made a fair start.
Except for the Parliamentary War, which did not disturb
the industry of the country very much—for there is no
sign of undue exaltation of prices, or anything else that
points to commercial distress—England was free from
the terrible conflicts that desolated half Europe in the
Thirty Years’ War. Our own Civil War was conducted
with hardly any of the bloodshed, plunder, and rapine
that make war so disastrous. But the Thirty Years’ War
(1619–1648) did not cease till the utter exhaustion of the
combatants made peace inevitable, and till every leader
who had taken part in the beginning of the war was in his
grave. Germany was effectually ruined, and with Germany
and Flanders laid low, England had little to fear
from foreign competition. And just at this moment the
folly of our neighbour, the French King Louis XIV., induced
him to deprive his nation of most of its skilled
workmen, by the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
His loss was our gain. The Edict in question, passed
nearly a century previously, had insured freedom of
worship to the French Huguenots, who comprised in their
ranks the <i>élite</i> of the industrial population. Louis XIV.
set to work to exterminate the Protestant religion in
France, and began by revoking this Edict (1685). Once
more England profited by her
Protestantism, and, owing <span id="p135" class="xxpn">{135}</span>
to the religious opinions of her people, received a fresh
accession of industrial strength. Some thousands of
skilled Huguenot artisans and manufacturers came over
and settled in this land. They greatly improved the silk,
glass, and paper trades, and exercised considerable influence
in the development of domestic manufactures
generally. It is said that the immigrants numbered
50,000 souls, with a capital of some
£3,000,000.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn42" id="fnanc42">42</a>
Everyone knows how they introduced the silk industry into this
country, and how Spitalfields long remained a colony of
Huguenot silk weavers. Their descendants are to be
found in every part of England.</div>

slanting lines.</p></div></div><!--dctr02-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
Distribution of the cloth trade</h4>—From this time
forward the cloth trade, in especial, took its place among
the chief industries of the country, largely owing to the
fresh spirit infused into it, first by Flemish, and afterwards
by French weavers. It became more and more
widely distributed. The county of Kent, and the towns
of York and Reading made one kind of cloth of a
heavy texture, the piece being thirty or thirty-four yards
long by six and one-half quarters broad, and weighing
66 lbs. to the piece. Worcester, Hereford, and Coventry
made a lighter kind of fabric, while throughout the eastern
counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex were made cloths
of various kinds—plunkets, azures, blues, long cloth, bay,
say, and serges; Suffolk, in particular, made a “fine,
short, white cloth.” Wiltshire and Somerset made
plunkets and handy warps; Yorkshire, short cloths.
Broad-listed whites and reds, and fine cloths, also came
from Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire; and
Somerset was famous in the eastern part for narrow-listed
whites and reds, and in the west for “dunsters.”
Devonshire made kerseys and grays,
as also did <span id="p136" class="xxpn">{136}</span>
Yorkshire and Lancashire. The Midlands furnished “Penistone”
cloths and “Forest whites”; while Westmoreland
was the seat of the manufacture of the famous
“Kendal green” cloths, as also of “Carpmael” and
“Cogware” fabrics. It will be seen that the manufacture
was exceedingly extensive, and that special
fabrics derived their names from the chief centre where
they were made. It may be mentioned here, too,
that the value of wool shorn in England at the end of
the seventeenth century was £2,000,000, from about
12,000,000 sheep (according to Youatt); and the cloth
manufactured from it was valued at £6,000,000 or
£8,000,000. Nearly half-a-century later (1741) the number
of sheep was reckoned at 17,000,000, the value of
wool shorn at £3,000,000, and of wool manufactured at
£8,000,000, showing that progress in invention had not
done much to enhance the value of the manufactured
article. But in 1774, when the Industrial Revolution
may be said to have fairly begun, the value of manufactured
wool was £13,000,000, the value of raw wool
(£4,500,000) being smaller in proportion.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
Coal-mines</h4>—Turning now from textile manufactures
to mining and working in metals, we find that in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries we were just upon
the eve of the most important changes in these industries—changes
which, in many places, have entirely transformed
the face of the country. But it cannot be too clearly
understood that none of our mining and mineral industries
attained any proportions worth speaking of till what is
known as the Industrial Revolution. Englishmen seem
to have had hardly any idea of the vast wealth of coal and
iron that has placed us in the forefront of Europe as a
manufacturing nation. Nevertheless we may just glance
at the imperfect methods which our
forefathers used up <span id="p137" class="xxpn">{137}</span>
till the eighteenth century. Coal-mining had been carried
on fairly extensively by the Romans, as for instance the
discovery of huge cinder-heaps at Aston and other places
testifies. Then, like all our industries, it was almost
entirely given up, and it was due to the Norman Conquest
that coal-mining was revived. That it was practised
to some extent in the North is seen from an entry in
the <i>Boldean Book</i> (a kind of Domesday of the county of
Durham, composed in 1183), in which a smith is allowed
twelve acres of land for making the ironwork of the carts,
and has to provide his own coal. But collieries were not
opened at Newcastle till the thirteenth century, in the
year 1238. In the next year we find notice of the first
public recognition of coal as an article of commerce, and
from a charter of Henry III. to the freemen of Newcastle,
we may date the foundation of the coal trade. In 1273
this had become sufficiently extensive for the use of coal
to be forbidden in London; as there was a prejudice
against it and in favour of wood as fuel. In the fourteenth
century, again, the monks of Tynemouth Priory
engaged in mining speculation, and (1380) leased a
colliery for £5. In the fifteenth century trade was sufficiently
important to form a source of revenue, for a tax
of twopence per chaldron was placed upon sea-borne coal,
and in 1421 an Act had to be passed to enforce this tax.
In fact in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries coal-mining
became general in Great Britain.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Development of coal trade: seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries</h4>—By the seventeenth century it had also
become important—important enough for the needy
Stuart monarch Charles I. to see in it a chance of revenue.
This king gave to Sir Thomas Tempest and his partners
the monopoly of the sale of Newcastle coal for twenty-one
years, beginning in 1637; and next year
he allowed a <span id="p138" class="xxpn">{138}</span>
syndicate to be incorporated which was to buy up all the
coal from Newcastle, Sunderland and Berwick, and sell it
in London for “not more than 17<i>s.</i> a ton in summer, and
19<i>s.</i> in winter”—an extravagant price for those times.
The king got a shilling a ton out of this ingenious scheme.
However, the Long Parliament finally put a stop to this
outrageous monopoly.</div>

<p>But although the coal trade was fairly extensive for that
period, it was utterly insignificant compared with its present
dimensions, and that for a very good reason. There
was no means of pumping water out of the mines, except
by the old-fashioned air-pump, which was of course utterly
inadequate. Nor was a suitable invention discovered till
the very end of the seventeenth century, when Thomas
Savery in 1698 invented a kind of pump, worked by the
condensation of steam. This rather clumsy invention,
however, was soon superseded in 1705 by Newcomen’s
steam pump. But it was not till after the commencement
of the Industrial Revolution that steam power was scientifically
applied to coal-mines by the inventions of Watt
and Boulton (1765 and 1774), which we shall notice in
their proper place. Up to that time, also, it was difficult
to transport coal into inland districts by road, Newcastle
coal being carried to London in ships, and then carried up
inland rivers in barges. But these barges could not go
high up many rivers at that time, and canals were not yet
made. It was difficult for instance to get coal to Oxford,
for it had to come to London, and then part way up the
Thames, which was not then navigable so far. But at
Cambridge it was easily procurable, for barges could come
right up to the town from eastern ports. Hence it was
much cheaper at Cambridge than at Oxford.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
The iron trade</h4>—As it had been with coal, so with
iron. Only very small quantities of it were
mined in the <span id="p139" class="xxpn">{139}</span>
Middle Ages; it was smelted only by wood, as a rule, and
was manufactured only in a very rude way. We saw
that at the great fairs foreign iron, chiefly from the Biscay
coast, was much in demand, as our own supply was utterly
insufficient. It was naturally not until we learnt to mine
and use our coal properly that we learnt also how to mine
and manufacture our iron. Before learning this, English
workmen used wood as fuel, and it is to this cause that we
owe the destruction of most of the forests which, at the
time of Domesday, occupied so large an area. “The
waste and destruction of the woods in the counties of
Warwick, Stafford, Hereford, Monmouth, Gloucester, and
Salop by these iron-works is not to be imagined,” a
speaker said in Parliament as late as the beginning of the
eighteenth century. And as wood was used as house-fuel
also, it will readily be understood what a vast destruction
of timber took place. In 1581 the erection of iron-works
within certain distances from London and the Thames
was prohibited “for the preservation of the woods.”</div>

<p>But early in the seventeenth century (1619) Dud
Dudley, son of Lord Dudley, began to make use of sea and
pit coal for smelting iron, and obtained a monopoly “of
the mystery and art of smelting iron-ore, and of making
the same into cast works or bars, in furnaces, with
bellows.” Dudley sold this cast-iron at £12 a ton, and
made a good profit out of it. He actually produced seven
tons a week, which was considered a large supply, and
shows the comparative insignificance of the industry then.
However, it was only comparatively insignificant, for
before the close of the century it was calculated that
180,000 tons of iron were produced in England yearly;
and in the eighteenth century (1719) iron came third in the
list of English manufactures, and the trade gave employment
to 200,000 people. There was,
however, still great <span id="p140" class="xxpn">{140}</span>
waste of wood, since a great many ironmasters did not use
coal, and therefore the export and even the manufacture
of iron was discouraged by legislation to such an extent
that by 1740 the output had been reduced to 17,350 tons
per annum, barely a tenth of the previous amount
quoted. The waste of timber was most noticeable in
the Sussex Wealden, the forests of which owe their destruction
almost entirely to the iron and glass manufactures.</p>

<p>But about this time another inventor, Darby, discovered
the secret of the large blast furnace in which pit
coal and charcoal were used. He began his experiments
as early as 1730, but did not do much for some twenty
years. In 1756, however, his works were “at the top
pinnacle of prosperity; twenty and twenty-two tons per
week sold off as fast as made, and profit enough.”</p>

<p>After Darby came Smeaton, and other inventors, and
the Industrial Revolution spread to the iron trade. We

Pottery</h4>—As with all other manufactures, so too the
development of pottery was reserved for the Renaissance
of industry in the eighteenth century. Of course pottery
of a kind had always been made in England, especially
where the useful soil of Staffordshire formed a favourable
ground for the exercise of this art. But the pottery
hitherto manufactured had been rude and coarse, and its
manufacture was a strictly domestic and not very widespread
industry. We owe its improvement, as in so
many other cases, largely to the efforts of the Dutch and
Huguenot immigrants of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. For the Dutch had been great among the
potters of Europe, as the renown of Delft-ware still
testifies, and France had the honour of being the land of
Palissy. The factories at Burslem owed
their origin to <span id="p141" class="xxpn">{141}</span>
the industry of two Germans, called Elers, from whom an
Englishman, Astbury, learnt the secret of producing the
red unglazed Japanese ware, and the black Egyptian
ware. Burslem, too, was the birthplace of Josiah Wedgwood,
born 1730, who first began business in 1752 as
manager for a master-potter, but started in business on his
own account in 1759, the eve of the Industrial Revolution.
His efforts and experiments were magnificent and untiring,
and they can be read at leisure in various biographical
works. It is sufficient here to say that Wedgwood was
the man who first made the art of pottery a science, and
before his death in 1795 he had brought this manufacture
to such a pitch of excellence, that few improvements have
been left for his successors to make, and it rose to be one
of the chief industries of the country.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 9.</span>
Other mining industries</h4>&mdash;There remain one or two
industries that require a passing mention, but which were
not in the eighteenth century of much importance. As
to the metals, the foreign trade in tin and lead has been
already mentioned. In the reign of John the tin-mines of
Cornwall were farmed by the Jews, and the tin and lead
trade must have attained considerable proportions in the
fourteenth century, for the Black Prince paid his own expenses
in the French wars by the produce of his mines of
those metals in Devonshire. Copper, also, was mined in
the northern counties, and in a statute of 15 Edward III.
(1343) we find grants of mines given at Skeldane, in Northumberland;
at Alston Moor, in Cumberland; and at
Richmond, in Yorkshire; a royalty of one-eighth going
to the king, and one-ninth to the lord of the manor.
Keswick was at that time a centre of this industry; but
there cannot have been any great output, for copper had
to be imported from Germany in the fifteenth century.
The mines were also very primitive,
the approaches being <span id="p142" class="xxpn">{142}</span>
made not by shafts, but by adits in the side of a convenient
hill. Another mineral, which is very abundant in
England, especially in Worcestershire and Cheshire, was
at this period hardly utilized. Salt was a necessary of life
to the English householder, for he had to salt his meat
for the winter; but he did not know how to mine it himself,
and either got it imported from south-west France or
contented himself with the inferior article evaporated on
the sea-coast, until the end of the seventeenth century.</div>

<p>In this place, too, we may mention that brickmaking
was a lost art from the fifth to the fifteenth century, and
bricks were not even imported. The first purchase of
bricks to be recorded was at Cambridge, in 1449; but
before the end of the fifteenth century it became a common
building material in the eastern counties, and in the
sixteenth century was generally used in London and in
the counties along the lower course of the Thames.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 10.</span>
The close of the period of manual industries</h4>&mdash;We
have now reached a turning-point in English industrial
history, and are about to study a period that is in every
way a violent contrast to the centuries which preceded it.
We have come to the time when machinery begins to displace
unaided manual labour. Hitherto all our manufactures,
our mining, and of course our agriculture, had
been performed by the literal labour of men’s hands, only
slightly helped by a few simple inventions. Industry,
too, was not organized upon a vast capitalistic basis,
though of course capitalists existed; but it would be
more correct to say that hitherto industry had been
chiefly carried on by numbers of smaller capitalists who
were also manual workmen, even when they employed
other workmen under them. Only in agriculture had
the capitalist class become very far removed from the
labourers. There was certainly no
such violent contrast <span id="p143" class="xxpn">{143}</span>
as now exists between a mill-owner and a mill-hand in
the realm of manufacturing industry, though of course
this contrast existed between the rich land-owner who
received rents, and the poor agricultural labourer whose
labour helped to pay them. But, speaking of industry
generally, it may be said that the absence of machinery
kept employers and workmen more upon a common level,
and as large factories of course did not exist, industry was
carried on chiefly in the workmen’s homes, and the workman
was not merely a unit among hundreds of unknown
“hands” in a mill, but a person not hopelessly removed
in social rank from his employer, who was well acquainted
with him, and like him worked with his own hands.</div>

<p>But now this old order of things passes away, and a new order
appears, ushered in by the whir and rattle of machinery and the mighty
hiss of steam. A complete transformation takes place, and the life of
England stirs anew in the great Industrial Revolution.</p>

THE EVE OF THE REVOLUTION</span></h3>

Industry and politics. Land-owners and merchant
princes</h4>&mdash;We are, of course, mainly concerned in this book
with industrial facts; but as these underlie all politics and
national history, we must pause for a moment to see how
the growth of commerce had by this time affected the
relations of two great classes: the land-owners and their
new rivals, the great merchants and the commercial
classes generally. Up to the time of the deposition of
James II., or the Whig Revolution of 1688, as it is sometimes
called, the land-owning class had been practically
supreme in social and political influence. But from that
time forward, although they still held this high position,
their influence was heavily counterbalanced by that of the
mercantile classes. The capitalist and the commercial
magnates were all favoured by the great movement which
divided the nation into the two historic parties of Whigs
and Tories, for it was that movement which first accentuated
their importance in the political life of the nation.
That importance was still more accentuated by a series of
significant economic events which took place shortly after
the Revolution; namely, the foundation of
the Bank of <span id="p145" class="xxpn">{145}</span>
England (1694),&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn43" id="fnanc43">43</a>
the new and extended Charter granted
to the East India Company in 1693, the beginning of the
National Debt in the same year, and the Restoration of
the Currency in 1696. The commercial and industrial
section of the community was becoming more and more
prominent, and the great Whig families who occupied
themselves with endeavouring to rule England in the
eighteenth century, relied for their support upon the
middle and commercial classes. The old reverence, however,
for the position of a land-owner had not yet died
out, and the men who had gained their wealth by
commerce strove for a higher social position by buying
land in large quantities. The time had not yet
come when a merchant was on equal terms with a
landlord.</div>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>In fact there has always been an extraordinary sentimentalism
as regards land among all classes of the English
people; and for some reason that has never been fully
explained a man who has merely inherited a large amount
of land (even if he has never attempted to cultivate it) is
regarded as being superior to one who has amassed a
fortune in the industrial or commercial world. And this
feeling was stronger in the eighteenth century than it is
at the present time. Hence commercial magnates bought
land, and with it social prestige. The James Lowther
who was created Earl of Lonsdale in 1784 was the descendant
of a merchant engaged in the Levant trade; the
first Earl of Tilney was the son of that eminent man of
business, Sir Josiah Child. The daughters of merchant
princes were even allowed to marry&mdash;and maintain&mdash;the
scions of a needy aristocracy. Defoe actually discovered
the amazing and revolutionary fact that a man engaged in
commerce might be a gentleman, though
no doubt this <span id="p146" class="xxpn">{146}</span>
bold supposition of his was at first looked upon with
incredulity. He says: “Trade is so far from being inconsistent
with a gentleman that in England trade makes a
gentleman; for, <i>after a generation or two</i>, the tradesman’s
children come to be as good gentlemen, statesmen, parliament
men, judges, bishops, and noblemen as those of the
highest birth and the most ancient families.” Dean
Swift remarked “that the power which used to follow
land had gone over to money.” Dr Johnson announced
oracularly that “an English merchant was a new species
of gentleman.”</p>

<p>Now, the Industrial Revolution went still further to
gain social and political influence for the commercial
classes. It succeeded in destroying the foolish idea that
the land-owners alone were to be looked upon as the
leaders of the nation. It gave the capitalists and
manufacturers a new accession of power by enormously
increasing their wealth. Moreover, it helped to undermine
the landed interest by making the manufactures
of England at first equal, and afterwards superior, to her
agriculture, so that a rich mill-owner or ironmaster
became as important as a large land-owner. The monopoly
of the landed interest was broken by capital. Nowhere
is the contrast between the old and new classes in
the last century seen more closely than in Scott’s <i>Rob
Roy</i>, where the old Tory squire who held fast to Church
and king is contrasted with the new commercial magnate
who supported the House of Hanover. One good we
enjoyed from the rise of the commercial classes, and that
was the final overthrow of the Stuarts, with all the
follies which that unfortunate race represented.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
The coming of the capitalists</h4>&mdash;Now, although the
commercial capitalist was fast coming into prominence as
the rival of the land-owner, he was
becoming still more <span id="p147" class="xxpn">{147}</span>
prominent as the master of the workmen whom he
employed. For before the Industrial Revolution the
capitalist had occupied a comparatively subordinate
place. The vast enterprises of modern industry, such as
railways or mills, which often require so large an expenditure
of capital before they can begin to be in any
way remunerative, were practically unknown a century
ago. The industrial system was, moreover, far less complicated,
far less international, far less subdivided.
Instead of the great capitalist manufacturers of to-day,
who can control the markets of a nation, England possessed
numbers of smaller capitalists, with far less
capital, both individually and in the aggregate, than
what is now required by a man who undertakes even
a moderate business. The large capitalists of the last
century were chiefly the foreign trading companies. For
English home manufactures, although greatly developed,
were still largely conducted upon the domestic system,
and the small capitalist-artisan was a conspicuous feature
of that time, just as the large mill-owner or ironmaster
is of our own day. Manufactures were carried on by a
number of small master-manufacturers, who gave out
work to be done in the homes of their employés; and
who often combined agricultural with manufacturing
pursuits. But nevertheless there were signs of the
approach of modern capitalist methods, of production
upon a large scale. It was becoming increasingly the
custom to employ a large number of workpeople together
under one roof, or at least under the direction and supervision
of one great manufacturer. Arthur Young, for
instance, mentions a silk mill at Sheffield with 152 hands&mdash;a
large number in the eighteenth century; a factory
at Boynton with 150 hands; and a master-manufacturer
at Darlington who ran above fifty looms.
Work was also <span id="p148" class="xxpn">{148}</span>
given out by capitalist manufacturers or merchants to
workmen to do at home in the villages and towns. These
workmen were, like the employés of the present day,
entirely dependent upon their employer for work and
wages. Thus, at Nottingham in 1750 we find fifty
master-manufacturers who “put out” work in this way
for as many as 1200 looms in the hosiery trade.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
The class of small manufacturers</h4>&mdash;But although the
coming of the capitalists was now near at hand the old
order of things was not seriously disturbed till the application
of steam power to machinery some years later.
There were still many small manufacturers who lived on
their own land and worked with their workpeople in their
own houses. Defoe in his <i>Tour through Great Britain</i>
(made in 1724–26) gives an interesting account of this
class at a time when they were in the height of their
prosperity, before machinery and steam had even begun
to cause their disappearance. Speaking of the land near
Halifax, in Yorkshire, he says: “The land was divided
into small enclosures from two acres to six or seven each,
seldom more, every three or four pieces of land having a
house belonging to them; hardly a house standing out of
speaking distance from another. We could see at every
house a tenter, and on almost every tenter a piece of
cloth or kersie or shalloon. At every considerable house
there was a manufactory. Every clothier keeps one
horse at least to carry his manufactures to the market;
and every one generally keeps a cow or two or more for
his family. By this means the small pieces of enclosed
land about each house are occupied, for they scarce sow
corn enough to feed their poultry. The houses are full
of lusty fellows, some at the dye-vat, some at the looms,
others dressing the cloths; the women and children
carding or spinning; being all
employed, from the <span id="p149" class="xxpn">{149}</span>
youngest to the oldest.” And Defoe adds a remark
which is certainly not applicable either to Halifax or any
other manufacturing town of the present day, for he
concludes his description with the words: “not a beggar
to be seen, or an idle person.”</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The condition of the manufacturing population</h4>&mdash;For
it is a significant fact that under the old domestic
system, simple and cumbrous as it was, the manufacturing
population was very much better off than it was for
some time after the Industrial Revolution. For one
thing, they still lived more or less in the country and were
not crowded together in stifling alleys and courts, or long
rows of bare smoke-begrimed streets, in houses like so
many dirty rabbit-hutches. Even if the artisan did live
in a town at that time, the town was very different from
the abodes of smoke and dirt which now prevail in the
manufacturing districts. There were no tall chimneys,
belching forth clouds of evil smoke; no huge, hot factories
with their hundreds of windows blazing forth a
lurid light in the darkness, and rattling with the whir
and din of ceaseless machinery by day and night. There
were no gigantic blast furnaces rising amid blackened
heaps of cinders, or chemical works poisoning the fields
and trees for miles around. These were yet to come.
The factory and the furnace were almost unknown.
Work was carried on by the artisan in his little stone or
brick house, with the workshop inside, where the wool
for the weft was carded and spun by his wife and
daughters, and the cloth was woven by himself and his
sons. He had also, in nearly all cases, his plot of land
near the house, which provided him both with food and
recreation, for he could relieve the monotony of weaving
by cultivating his little patch of ground, or feeding his
pigs and poultry. Work too was more
regular than it <span id="p150" class="xxpn">{150}</span>
often is at present, for there were fewer commercial
fluctuations; fashions did not change so quickly, and
the market for home-spun fabrics was always steady and
assured. The relations between employers and employed
were far closer; even the distribution of wealth was comparatively
more equal. Wages were of course less in
money value than at present, but then prices of food and
rent were only about half what they are now. Arthur
Young gives 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> as the average weekly wages of an
artisan in the North and Midland counties, while the
average rent for a cottage in the same counties he puts
at <span class="nowrap">28<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i></span> a year, or
only 6&#x2060;½<i>d.</i> per week. And it must be
remembered that this included a piece of land round the
cottage. Meat, also, was cheap, being from 2&#x2060;½<i>d.</i> to 3&#x2060;¼<i>d.</i>
per pound; and bread 1&#x2060;¼<i>d.</i> a pound. In fact we may
confidently say that artisans, especially spinners and
weavers, were well off about 1760. Adam Smith testifies
to this in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>. “Not only has grain
become somewhat cheaper,” he says, “but many other
things from which the industrious poor derive an agreeable
and wholesome variety of food have become a great
deal cheaper.” And the healthy condition of industry
in general is shown by the fact that at the close of the
wars with France by the Peace of 1763, when more than
100,000 men accustomed to war were thrown upon the
country and had to find work or else be supported somehow
or other, “not only no great convulsion, but no
sensible disorder arose.”</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
Condition of the agricultural population</h4>&mdash;Nor
was that convenient plenty which was the lot of the
manufacturing portion of the people confined only to that
section. The condition of the agricultural labourer, who
was generally the worst off of all classes from being so
much under the direct supervision of
his master, had <span id="p151" class="xxpn">{151}</span>
considerably improved, together with the general improvement
of agriculture spoken of in a previous chapter.
The price of corn had fallen, while wages had risen,
though these were less than an artisan’s, being, according
to Arthur Young’s average estimate for the North and
Midland counties, about 7<i>s.</i> a week. But it was generally
8<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i>, while the board of a working man may be
placed at about 5<i>s.</i> or 6<i>s.</i> a week. Cottages were occasionally
rent free, or at any rate only paid a low rent,
never more than 50<i>s.</i> or 60<i>s.</i> per year. There was an
abundance of food, clothing, and furniture. Wheat-bread
had entirely superseded rye-bread. Every poor
family now drank tea, which had formerly been a costly
luxury. The consumption of meat was, says Arthur
Young, “pretty considerable,” and that of cheese
“immense.” Indeed he states that the labourers “by
their large wages and the cheapness of all necessaries
enjoyed better dwellings, diet, and apparel in England
than the husbandmen or farmers did in other countries.”
Certainly Arthur Young must have been struck with the
difference between the agricultural population of England
and that of France, which latter country he visited
shortly before the Revolution, when the misery of the
labourers was at its lowest depth, thanks to the extortions
of the privileged noblesse.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Growth of population</h4>&mdash;But not only had the condition
of the industrial population improved in the period
1700–1750, but their numbers had also considerably
increased. And now too was beginning that great shifting
of the centres of population from the South to the North
of England, which is so important a feature in the new
industrial epoch. The most suggestive fact of this period
is the growth of the population of Lancashire and of the
West Riding of Yorkshire, which
were rapidly becoming <span id="p152" class="xxpn">{152}</span>
the seats of the cotton and coarse woollen manufactures.
Similarly also Staffordshire and Warwickshire, the
pottery and hardware centres, were growing in numbers,
and so, too, were Durham and Northumberland, whose
coal-fields were now far more developed than before.
On the other hand, the population of the Western and
Eastern counties, still large manufacturing centres, had
increased very little. But in the North and North-west
the increase was enormous. Between 1685 and 1760 the
people of Liverpool had increased tenfold, of Manchester
fivefold, of Birmingham and Sheffield sevenfold. The
total population of England had increased from the five
millions or so of Elizabeth’s time, to not much less than
eight millions in Arthur Young’s time, and far more of
these were in the northern portions of the country than
was the case even in Defoe’s time. Defoe said in 1725,
“the country south of the Trent is by far the largest, as
well as the richest and most populous.” But forty or
fifty years later the shifting towards the North had
already made itself felt. The cause of the great increase
of population between 1700 and 1760 is to be found in the
rapid increase of national wealth gained by foreign commerce,
in the progress of home manufactures and of
agriculture. Increased wealth means increased comfort
in living, increased command of food, and consequently
better chances of survival among children born of poor
parents. And in this period the increase in national
wealth was, in spite of foreign wars, enormous; for if
England had to pay heavily for these wars other countries
had to pay more heavily still, and were, moreover, the
battle-grounds of contending armies, while our own land
was at least free from invasion.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
England still mainly agricultural</h4>&mdash;Of the population
of the country at this time the
majority were still <span id="p153" class="xxpn">{153}</span>
engaged in agriculture, and the agricultural labourers
alone formed one-third of the working classes, and a large
number even of the manufacturing classes still worked in
the fields for a portion of the year, especially in harvest-time.
In 1770 England was still mainly an agricultural
country, and Arthur Young estimates that the income
of the agricultural portion of the nation was larger than
that of all the rest of the community. But it must be
remembered that by far the largest portion of this income
was in the hands of large land-owners and the farmers,
the share of the labourer being of course much smaller.
Arthur Young’s estimates must be taken with a certain
amount of caution, but they are probably approximately
correct, and are certainly interesting as giving us a very
fair idea of the distribution of occupations and national
wealth just before the Industrial Revolution. Hence I
append a small table, giving in round numbers the
figures of his estimates. It will be noticed that the
number of the population is rather too high, but the
proportion of one class to another is probably correct.</div>

<p>It will be perceived that the agriculturists, though only
about half a million more in numbers than the manufacturing
classes, had a far larger proportionate income,
in fact more than double. This was of course partly due
to the agricultural improvements of this period, and to
the fact that manufactures were still carried on almost
solely by hand, thus giving only a small production from
a good many workmen. But the Industrial Revolution
rapidly changed all this, and now agriculture is no longer
the staple industry of the country. We may here refer
to what has been previously mentioned in regard to the
agricultural development on enclosed land, and to the
superiority of the results of enclosures over common
fields. Those farmers and large owners who understood
the best ways of raising crops prospered, and more and
more land was enclosed every year to grow corn (which
by the way was rapidly rising in price), clover, turnips and
other root-crops. No less than 700 Enclosure Acts were
passed between 1760 and 1774. The old common fields
were beginning to disappear, and the working classes also
lost their rights of pasturing cattle on the wastes, for
wastes now were enclosed. It must be admitted that
the old common-field system produced very poor results
(cf. p. <a href="#p041" title="go to p. 41">41</a>), but the loss of his common
rights was very <span id="p155" class="xxpn">{155}</span>
disastrous to the labourer, for it drove him off the land
at the same time as the growth of manufactures attracted
him off from it, and thus the labourer became in a few
years completely divorced from the soil. At present
attempts are being made to attract him back to it by
offering him small strips of inferior land at a high rent.
This is known as the allotment system. It need scarcely
be said that, as at present carried out, it is hardly likely
to succeed.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn45" id="fnanc45">45</a></p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
The domestic system of manufacture</h4>&mdash;But in the
period we are now speaking of, the period before the
great inventions, neither the agricultural labourer nor the
manufacturing operative was quite divorced from the
land. The weavers, for instance, often lived in the country,
in a cottage with some land attached to it. There had
certainly been changes in the industrial system before
1760. At first the weaver had furnished himself with
warp and weft, worked it up, and brought it to the market
himself; but by degrees this system grew too cumbersome,
and the yarn was given out by merchants to the
weaver, and at last the merchant got together a certain
number of looms in a town or village, and worked them
under his own supervision. But even yet the domestic
system, as it is commonly called, retained in many if not
in most cases the distinctive feature that the manufacturing
industry was not the only industry in which
the artisan was engaged, but that he generally combined
with it a certain amount of agricultural work in the cultivation
of his own small plot of land. This fact explains
to some extent the comparative comfort of the operative
in this cottage industry, for that they were fairly well
off is the testimony of Adam Smith, in 1776. Commercial
fluctuations were few; the home
market was steady; <span id="p156" class="xxpn">{156}</span>
employer and employed were more closely knit together
than at present; wealth was more equally distributed,
and capital existed in smaller amounts but in a larger
number of hands. The poet’s vision of “contentment
spinning at the cottage door” was not altogether
imaginary, for women and children shared in the common
task brought home by the head of the family. Nor,
after all, was trade so restricted and hampered as some
writers have seemed to suppose. On the contrary,
there was, in spite of bad roads, very frequent and considerable
internal communication for manufacturing purposes,
and this was facilitated by means of the local
markets, the importance of which in those days cannot be
easily overrated. Manufacturers would ride a long way
to buy wool from the farmers or at the great fairs already
mentioned, such as that of Stourbridge (p. <a href="#p063" title="go to p. 63">63</a>), which was
sufficiently considerable even a hundred years ago, or
those of Lynn, Boston, Gainsborough, and Beverley, all
four of which were celebrated for their wool-sales. This
wool was then brought home and sorted; then sent out
to the hand-combers, and on being returned combed was
again sent out, often to long distances, to be spun.
It was, for instance, sent from remote parts of Yorkshire
to Lancashire, or even farther; or again from near
London to Kendal and back. When spun, the tops, or
fine wool, were entrusted to some shopkeeper to “put
out” among the neighbours. Then the yarn was brought
back and sorted by the manufacturer himself into hanks,
according to the counts and twist. The hand-weavers
would next come for their warp and weft, and in due time
bring back the piece, which often was sent elsewhere to
be dyed. Finally, the finished cloth was sent to be sold
at the fairs, or at the local “piece halls” of such central
towns as Leeds or Halifax. <span id="p157" class="xxpn">{157}</span></div>

<p>Hence it will be seen that there was a considerable
diffusion of work under the old system, and it was not
necessary for great numbers of people to live close together,
or work in factories upon a large scale. Things
were done with greater leisure, and more time was taken
over them. But with the Industrial Revolution came
all the hurry and stress of modern manufacturing life,
and a complete change took place in the manner and
methods of manufacture. And now, having seen how
things stood immediately before this great change, we
can proceed at once to the means by which it was brought
about.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II
<span class="hsmall">
THE EPOCH OF THE GREAT INVENTIONS</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
The suddenness of the Revolution and its importance</h4>&mdash;The
change from the domestic system of industry
which has been briefly sketched in the previous chapter
to the modern system of production by machinery and
steam power, was sudden and violent. The great inventions
were all made in a comparatively short space
of time, and the previous slow growth of industry
developed quickly into a feverish burst of manufacturing
production that completely revolutionized the face of
industrial England. In little more than twenty years
all the great inventions of Watt, Arkwright, and Boulton
had been completed, steam had been applied to the new
looms, and the modern factory system had fairly begun.
Nothing has done more to make England what she at
present is&mdash;whether for better or worse&mdash;than this sudden
and silent Industrial Revolution, for it increased her
wealth tenfold, and gave her half-a-century’s start in
front of the nations of Europe.
The French Revolution <span id="p158" class="xxpn">{158}</span>
took place about the same time, and as it was performed
amid streams of blood and flame, it attracted the attention
of historians, who have apparently yet to learn that
bloodshed and battles are merely the incidents of history.
The French Revolution also succeeded in giving birth to
one of the world’s military heroes, and a military hero
naturally excites the enthusiasm of the multitude. But
the French Revolution was the result of economic causes
that had been operating for centuries, and which had had
their effect in England four hundred years before, at the
time of the Peasants’ Revolt. These economic causes
have been rather kept in the background by modern
historians, and it was hardly to be expected that they
should recognize the operation of such causes in England;
more especially as their effects were not accentuated by
political fireworks, but were even partially hidden by subsequent
events resulting from these effects. Men were
blinded too by an increase in the wealth of the richer
portion of the nation, not even seeing whence that wealth
proceeded, and quite ignoring the fact that it was
accompanied by serious poverty among the industrial
classes. Nor did historians perceive that the world-famous
wars in which England was engaged at the close
of the last century and up to 1815, were necessitated by
England’s endeavour to gain the commercial supremacy
of the world, after she had invented the means of supplying
the world’s markets to overflowing. Economic causes
were at the root of them all. We shall discuss later the
connection between our foreign politics and our industry;
at present we must adhere to the subject of the development
of that industry by the
great inventors.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn46" id="fnanc46">46</a>
<span id="p159" class="xxpn">{159}</span></div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc46" id="fn46">46</a>
There was an Agricultural Revolution as important as the
Industrial one, but it is best to treat it separately. I have done
so in Ch. vi.</p></div>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
The great inventors</h4>&mdash;The transition from the
domestic to the factory system was begun by four great
inventions. In 1770 James Hargreaves, a weaver of
Standhill, near Blackburn, patented the spinning-jenny&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
a frame with a number of spindles side by side, which
were fed by machinery, and by which many threads
might be spun at once, instead of only one, as had been
the case in the old one-thread hand-spinning wheel.
Hargreaves first used this “jenny” for some time in his
own house, and was at once enabled to spin eight times
as much yarn as before. In 1771 Arkwright established
a successful mill at Cromford on the Derwent, in which
he employed his patent spinning machine, or “water-frame,”
an improvement upon a former invention of
Wyatt’s, which derived its name from the fact that it was
worked by water power. A few years later (1779) both
these inventions were superseded by that of Samuel
Crompton, a spinner, but the son of a farmer near Bolton.
His machine, the “mule,” combined the principles of
both the previous inventions, and was called by this name
as being the hybrid offspring of its mechanical predecessors.
It drew out the roving (<i>i.e.</i> the raw material
when it has received its first twist) by an adaptation of
the water-frame, and then passed it on to be finished and
twisted into complete yarn by an adaptation of the
spinning-jenny. This invention effected an enormous
increase in production, for nowadays 12,000 spindles are
often worked by it at once and by one spinner. It dates
from the year 1779, and was so successful that by 1811
more than four and a half million spindles worked by
“mules” were in use in various English factories. Like
many inventors Crompton died in poverty in 1827.</div>

<p>These three inventions, however, only increased the
power of spinning the raw material
into yarn. What <span id="p160" class="xxpn">{160}</span>
was now wanted was a machine that would perform the
same service for weaving. This was discovered by Dr
Cartwright, a Kentish parson, and was patented as the
“power-loom” in 1785, though it had afterwards to
undergo many improvements, and did not begin to be
much used till 1813. But the principle of it was there,
and it was one of the most important factors in the destruction
of the old domestic system. For at first only
spinning was done by machinery, and the weavers could
still do their work by hand in the old methods; and
indeed they continued to do so till a comparatively recent
period, and many old people in Northern manufacturing
districts can still remember the old weaving industry,
as carried on in the workmen’s own houses. But the
improvements on Cartwright’s invention did away with
the hand-weaver, as the others had abolished the hand-spinner,
and the old form of industry was doomed.</p>

<p>Its death-blow, however, was yet to come. Wondrous
as were the changes introduced by the machines just
spoken of none of them would have by themselves alone
revolutionized our manufacturing industries. Power of
some kind was needed to work them, and water power,
though used at first, was insufficient and not always
available. It was the application of steam to manufacturing
processes which finally completed the Industrial
Revolution. In 1769, the year in which Wellington and
Bonaparte were born, James Watt took out his patent
for the steam-engine. It was first used as an auxiliary
in mining operations, but in 1785 it was introduced into
factories, a Nottinghamshire cotton-spinner having one
set up in his works, which had previously been run only
by water power. Of course the enormous advantages
of steam over water power became immediately apparent;
manufacturers, especially in
the cotton trade, <span id="p161" class="xxpn">{161}</span>
hastened to make use of the new methods, and in fifteen
years (1788–1803) the cotton trade trebled itself.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
The revolution in manufactures and the factories</h4>&mdash;Although
these machines of which we have just spoken
were intended at first for use in the manufacture of cotton,
they rapidly extended to that of woollen and linen fabrics.
It is impossible here to describe all the various modifications
and adaptations that were thus made; we can only
refer to the general features of the great change. The
most remarkable of these features was the sudden growth
of factories, chiefly of course at first for spinning cotton
or woollen yarn. The old factories, had perforce been
planted by the side of some running stream, often in a
lonely and deserted spot, very inconvenient for markets
and the procuring of labour; but necessarily so placed
for the sake of the water. Those of my readers who know
Yorkshire or Lancashire fairly well may remember how
frequently in the course of some long country walk near
Bradford, Halifax, Leeds, or Manchester, they come
upon the ruins of some old mill, crumbling beside a
rushing stream, a silent relic of the old days before the
use of steam. How wonderful must the first rude inventions
have seemed to the workers in those old factories,
as the strange new machinery rattled and shook in the
quiet country hollows, and the becks and streamlets ran
down to turn the new spindles and looms that were to
revolutionize the face of agricultural England. But the
old water-mills gave way to others worked by steam
power, and now it was no longer necessary to choose any
particular site for the works. So the new race of manufacturers
made haste to run up steam-factories wherever
they could. “Old barns and cart-houses,” says Radcliffe,
“outbuildings of all descriptions were repaired;
windows broke through the old blank walls,
and all were <span id="p162" class="xxpn">{162}</span>
fitted up for loom-shops; new weavers’ cottages arose in
every direction.” The merchants too, who did not run
factories on their own account, but merely purchased
yarn, began to collect weavers around them in great
numbers, to get looms together in a workshop, and to
give out warp themselves to the workpeople. And now
the workers began to feel the difference between the old
system and the new. Formerly they used to buy for
themselves the yarn they were to weave, and had a
direct interest in the cloth they made from it, which was
their own property. They were in fact economically
independent. The new system made them dependent
upon the merchant or upon the mill-owner. At first, it is
true, they gained a rise in wages, for the increase in production
was so great that labour was continually in
demand, and every family, says Radcliffe, brought home
forty to one hundred and twenty shillings per week.
But this did not last very long. The new machinery soon
threw out of employment a number of those who had
worked only by hand; it enabled women and children
to do the work of grown men; it made all classes of
workers dependent upon capitalist employers; it introduced
an era of hitherto unheard-of competition. The
coming of the capitalists had become an accomplished
fact, and with it began again the exploitation of labour.
Of this we shall speak in another chapter. Other
national changes now demand our attention.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The growth of population and the development of
the Northern districts</h4>&mdash;The two most striking facts of
the Industrial Revolution are the great growth and the
equally great shifting of the population. Before 1751 the
largest decennial increase of population had been about 5
or 6 per cent. But for each of the next three periods of
ten years the increase became rapidly greater,
till in 1801 <span id="p163" class="xxpn">{163}</span>
it was 14 per cent. on the previous ten years, and reached
even 21&#x2060;½ per cent. in the period 1801 to 1811. This last
was the highest rate ever reached in England, and is more
than double that recorded in the census of 1881 or 1891.
The population of England had been under 8,000,000 in
1760; by 1821 it had risen to nearly 12,000,000; and
at the present moment it is certainly nearly treble that
number.</div>

<p>At the same time, the great migration to the North,
already begun before the Revolution, was now accelerated
and completed. The Northern counties, which in the
Middle Ages had, as we saw, been comparatively deserted,
now became and have since remained the most populous
and flourishing of all. The centres of the new factory
system were in the North, and thither flocked the workers
who had formerly been distributed over England in a
much more extensive manner, or who had clustered
round the great Eastern and Western centres of industry,
which before 1760 had excelled the other centre, the West
Riding, in prosperity. But now this was changed. Before
the Revolution, the Eastern counties, more especially
about Norwich and the surrounding districts, had been
famous for their manufactures of crapes, bombazines,
and other fine, slight stuffs. In the West of England the
towns of Bradford-on-Avon, Devizes, and Warminster
had been manufacturing centres noted for their fine
serges; Stroud had been the centre of the manufacture of
dyed cloth, and so had Taunton been, for even in Defoe’s
time (1725) it had 1100 looms; and the excellence of the
Cotswold wool had done much for the industry of the
district. These two centres and their productions, then,
were far more famous than the third, the West Riding,
including the towns of Halifax, Leeds, and Bradford,
where only coarse cloths were made.
The cotton trade <span id="p164" class="xxpn">{164}</span>
of Lancashire, too, had previously been insignificant, for
it was only incidentally mentioned by Adam Smith,
though Manchester and Bolton were then, as now, its
headquarters. In 1760 only 40,000 persons were engaged
in it, the annual value of the cotton manufacture was
comparatively insignificant, while in 1764 the value of our
cotton exports was only one-twentieth of our woollen, and
only strong cottons, such as dimities and fustians, were
made. But now the cotton cities of Lancashire and the
woollen and worsted factories of Yorkshire greatly surpass
the older seats of industry in wealth and population,
while the cotton export has risen to be the first in the
kingdom, and the vast majority of the industrial population
is now found North of the Trent. These great industrial
changes were the direct consequence of the introduction
of new manufacturing processes. For the use of
steam power in mills necessitated the liberal use of coal,
and hence the factory districts are necessarily almost coincident
with the great coal-fields, as will be seen from the
appended map.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn47" id="fnanc47">47</a>
Moreover, the coal industry had been
developed almost simultaneously with the growth of
manufactures, and indeed one reacted upon the other. It
will be convenient here to mention the improvements
made in coal-mining and in the iron trade.</p>

<div class="dftnt">

<div>Showing Coalfields and corresponding
Manufactures</div></div></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
The revolution in the mining industries</h4>&mdash;I have
mentioned in a previous chapter that the development of
the vast natural resources of our country
as regards coal <span id="p165" class="xxpn">{165}</span>
and iron was retarded by the lack of steam power (p. <a href="#p137" title="go to p. 137">137</a>).
But with the steam-engines of Watt and Boulton a new
era dawned upon coal-mining. In 1774 Watt, after
vainly advocating his invention, entered into partnership
with Matthew Boulton, a Birmingham man, and their new
engine soon produced a vast change in the manner of
pumping water from the mines, just as it also produced
other changes in every manufacture dependent upon the
use of coal. Steam power was used not only to clear the
mines of water, but also in sinking shafts, where formerly
entrance had often been made only by tunnelling in the
side of a hill. It was used too in bringing up the coal
from the pit, and in many other necessary processes.
The result of this application of steam power was soon
seen in the general opening up of all the English coal-fields,
and the consequent further growth of towns like
Newcastle, Sheffield, and Birmingham, whose industries
now depend so greatly upon a large supply of coal.</div>

<p>With the great output of coal came an immediate
revival of the iron trade, which it will be remembered had
greatly declined about 1737 and 1740, for as coal was not
available wood had to be used as fuel, and the consequent
destruction of forests, especially the Sussex Wealden, had
caused legislative prohibitions. The scientific treatment
of iron ore in the various processes of manufacture had
indeed been improved, but nothing much could be done
without coal. This was seen for instance by an ironmaster,
Anthony Bacon, in 1755, who obtained a lease
for 99 years of a district at Merthyr Tydvil, eight miles
long and five broad, upon which he erected both iron and
coal works. In 1760 Smeaton’s invention of a new blowing
apparatus at his works at Carron, near Falkirk, did
away with the old clumsy bellows; and the other inventions
of Cranage (1766), of Onions (1783),
and of Cort <span id="p166" class="xxpn">{166}</span>
(1784), for which separate treatises must be consulted,
brought the manufacture of iron almost to perfection.
Whereas about 1740 we produced only some 18,000 tons
of iron annually, and had to import at least 20,000 tons;
we produced in 1788 as much as 68,000 tons, and the production
has gone on steadily increasing to the present
time, when our export alone amounts to four and a half
million tons of iron and steel annually.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
The nation’s wealth and its wars</h4>&mdash;Of course these
discoveries of new processes in procuring coal and making
iron enormously increased the wealth of England, and at
the same time entirely changed the conditions of industry.
For they helped on the textile manufactures by
providing any amount of fuel and machinery, and all
these together gave employment to a population that
seemed to grow in accordance with the need of the nation
for workers. The new textile and mining industries
supplied England with that vast wealth which enabled
her to endure successfully the long years of war at the
close of last century and the beginning of this. The Industrial
Revolution came only just in time, for after the
repose of 1763 to 1792, during which this silent Revolution
matured and took root, England engaged in a struggle
which she certainly could never have supported without a
far greater national wealth than she possessed in the first
three quarters of the eighteenth century. And as it was,
the year 1815 found a large portion of her people in
poverty and distress, and the industrial classes suffered
heavily from the taxation which the war imposed. But
owing to her industrial development the war left England
at its close, in spite of all her troubles, the foremost
nation of Europe in economic matters, and consequently
in all other matters also. As is the case with most modern
wars, this great war originated in
economic causes, even <span id="p167" class="xxpn">{167}</span>
to a certain extent in economic mistakes, but it had important
effects upon industry and was largely affected by
industrial considerations. Hence we must consider it
rather more closely.</div>

<div class="section padtopb">
<h3>CHAPTER III
<span class="hsmall">
WARS, POLITICS, AND INDUSTRY</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
England’s industrial advantages in 1763</h4>&mdash;If we
look at the state of the European powers after the conclusion
of the Seven Years’ War by the Treaty of Paris in
1763, we shall see that England had achieved a very
favourable position for the growth of her internal industries.
It is true that along with the rest of Europe
she had adopted the policy of endeavouring to secure a
sole market for her goods, and though that policy was a
ruinous mistake she was not alone in her error, and since
other powers were doing the same, it was just as well that
she should hold the lead among them. And, as Professor
Rogers has remarked, since we are paying interest upon
the heavy national bills which we ran up at that time, we
may profitably examine what we gained thereby.</div>
</div><!--section-->

<p>In the first place, England had seriously crippled her
powerful commercial rival, France, both in her Indian and
American possessions. By the Seven Years’ War we had
gained Canada, Florida, and all the French possessions
east of the Mississippi River (except New Orleans); while
in India our influence had become supreme, owing to
the victories of Clive. French influence in India and
America was practically annihilated. Spain, the faithful
ally of France, lost with her friend her place as the commercial
rival of England in foreign
trade. Germany was <span id="p168" class="xxpn">{168}</span>
again being ravaged by the dynastic struggles in which
Frederick the Great bore so prominent a part, between the
reigning houses of Austria and Prussia. Holland was
similarly torn by internal dissensions under the Stadtholder
William V., which gave the rival sovereigns of
Prussia and Austria a chance of making matters worse
by their interference. By 1790 the United Provinces had
thus sunk into utter insignificance. Sweden, Norway,
and Italy were of no account in European politics, and
Russia had only begun to come to the front. Hence
England alone had the chance of “the universal empire
of a sole market.” The supply of this market, especially
in our American colonies, was in the hands of English
manufacturers and English workmen. The great inventions
which came, as we saw, after 1763 were thus at once
called into active employment, and our mills and mines
were able to produce wealth as fast as they could work
without fear of foreign competition.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
The mistake of the Mercantile Theory</h4>&mdash;But unfortunately
our capitalists made a great mistake in their
policy. The commercial mind of England was dominated
by what is known as the “Mercantile Theory.” It was a
theory that had grown up naturally out of the spirit of
Nationalism, of self-sustained and complete national life,
that was our heritage from the Renaissance and the Reformation.
It was not altogether wrong, for its object
was national greatness, an object laudable and harmless
enough. But the believers in the policy of increasing our
national greatness also believed that it could only be
attained in one way, and that was at the expense of our
neighbours. In one form and another the theory frequently
crops up even to-day, though we are supposed to
have repudiated it. The measures adopted to attain this
end were various and not
always unsuccessful. True, <span id="p169" class="xxpn">{169}</span>
our commercial forefathers made the mistake&mdash;not uncommon
even now&mdash;of believing that national wealth
consisted chiefly in holding large stores of gold and silver,
and hence they prohibited the export of bullion, till the
East India Company demonstrated the futility of this
scheme.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn48" id="fnanc48">48</a>
They endeavoured, too, to obtain a supply of
the precious metals by prohibiting the purchase of foreign
manufactures, and encouraging only the imports of raw
material, that we might sell our own manufactures for
foreign silver and gold. Hence proceeded wars of tariff,
as for instance when we prohibited the import of gold-lace
from Flanders, and the Flemish in revenge excluded our
exports of wool. But the most famous of the restrictions
imposed by this theory were the Navigation Acts of 1651,
by which it was ordered that no goods from Asia, Africa,
or America were to be imported into England or her
colonies, except in ships belonging to English subjects,
and no goods of any European country were to be imported
except in English vessels, or ships belonging to the
country from which the goods came. Of course these
Acts resulted in collision with Dutch interests, for the
Dutch were at that time the ocean carriers of the world.
We were driven out of neutral ports, and lost the Russian
and Baltic trade, because of the high charges of English
ship-owners, to whom this protective scheme gave a
monopoly of freights. But at the same time our shipping
trade gained a great stimulus, and our commercial supremacy
grew with it. Of course, however, this protective
measure made the country at large pay a higher price for
this privilege than was necessary, and we could probably
have done better without it. Nevertheless these Acts,
coupled with the development of our Indian and American
trade, resulted in giving us a
position of undoubted <span id="p170" class="xxpn">{170}</span>
commercial supremacy. Many other Protective measures,
of a worse kind than this, were passed owing to the dictates
of this theory, as for instance when in 1750 Parliament
forbade the importation of pig and bar iron from our
American colonies. But the Nemesis of this Protective
policy was sure to come, and come it did in that fatal folly
which caused us to lose those very colonies which we had
defended against the French in the Seven Years’ War.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc48" id="fn48">48</a>
See note 15, p. <a href="#p249" title="go to p. 249">249,</a> on this point.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
The loss of the American colonies</h4>&mdash;The way in
which English statesmen looked upon our colonies in the
last century was that they owed everything to England,
and that therefore it was only fair that they should be
exploited in the interests of the mother-country. Thus
all imports to our colonies from any other country of
Europe except England were forbidden, in order that our
manufacturers might monopolize the American market.
The criminal folly of our legislators went even further than
this, for every attempt was made to discourage the colonists
from starting manufactures at home. The American
woollen industry was practically suppressed; all iron
manufactures, as just mentioned, were forbidden in 1750;
even colonial hatters were not allowed to send hats from
one colony into another.</div>

<p>Nevertheless the American colonists evaded the regulations
that forbade them to trade with any but the mother-country,
and did, for instance, a considerable trade with
South America. But in George III.’s reign, Grenville, a
Whig minister, was foolish enough to try and stop this.
Moreover, he sought to raise money wherewith to pay for
the American portion of the Seven Years’ War by taxing
the colonists upon the stamps on legal papers (Stamp Act,
1765). The idea that the colonists should pay part of the
expenses of the war undertaken in their defence was just
enough; but that these expenses should be
defrayed by a <span id="p171" class="xxpn">{171}</span>
system of taxation in which they had no voice was exactly
the reverse. It is to the credit of Pitt that he protested
against this taxation without representation, and exerted
his influence for the repeal of this Act (1766). Thus the
feelings of the colonists were soothed for a time, and in
1770 Lord North took off all taxes except that on tea.
The colonists refused to buy tea: the East India Company,
whose trade naturally suffered, tried to force their
tea into America, and matters culminated in the celebrated
emptying of a shipload of it into Boston harbour
by the citizens of that port (1773). North tried to punish
the Bostonians by decreeing that their port should be
closed, and that the charter of Massachusetts, their
colony, should be annulled. Of course war was now
imminent. We need not here go into the details of that
unfortunate conflict, though we must mention the heroic
endeavours of Pitt, now Lord Chatham, to make England
give full redress to her offspring. His efforts were in vain.
France eagerly took the opportunity of assisting the
Americans against the English, and England had to pay
very dearly for her adherence to the Mercantile Theory.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The outbreak of the great Continental War</h4>&mdash;But although
the War of Independence cost us a great deal, it
did not greatly affect the development of our home industries.
The Industrial Revolution went steadily on,
and for just thirty years (1763–93) the country, though
not entirely at peace, was yet sufficiently undisturbed to
make rapid progress in the new manufacturing methods.
But in 1789 the French Revolution broke out, and for over
twenty years Europe was plunged into a disastrous and
exhausting conflict. At the first outbreak of the Revolution,
England looked on quietly. Many men were openly
glad that the downtrodden masses of the French nation
had overthrown the tyranny of an upper
class whose only <span id="p172" class="xxpn">{172}</span>
idea of their duty in life was to extort the last farthing
from those below them, in order to spend it in irresponsible
debauchery. Statesmen like Fox gloried in it; the
younger Pitt was anxious not to interfere. But Pitt was
forced into action by the capitalists, who now were equal
with the land-owners as the two ruling powers of England.
He saw that the conquests which the new French Republic
was already beginning to make might help France
to secure again her old position as the most formidable
rival of English commerce. If now this rival could be
finally struck down, England was sure of the control of the
world’s markets. It was obviously the policy of England
to check the power of France, and when war was declared
by the young Republic, England was not slow to answer
the challenge. After this England was plunged headlong
into the great European struggle of Monarchy against
Republicanism. Pitt gained the support of all classes at
home. The merchants and manufacturers were only too
glad to see their old rival ruined; the land-owners and
nobility were of course indignant at seeing the “lower
classes,” even of a foreign nation, rise against their lords,
even though their lords perhaps deserved their punishment.
It was generally believed, and it was largely true,
that England was fighting for the great principles of
Monarchy and Religion, exemplified by a foolish king and
a corrupted priesthood. For a time everyone supported
Pitt’s policy. But the French Revolution had found
many sympathizers among the working classes, and after
the country had felt the first severity of the burdens imposed
by the war, a spirit of discontent manifested itself.
But the nation at large was against this opposition, and
drastic measures were taken to silence it. Pitt was indomitable
till his death (in 1805), and under his guidance
England often fought single-handed
against the world. <span id="p173" class="xxpn">{173}</span>
At times, as in 1796, she was threatened with invasion by
the French, and the Irish, or a certain section of them,
assisted her would-be invaders. At another time (1806),
English industry was threatened with ruin by Napoleon’s
Berlin Decree, forbidding Continental nations to trade
with us.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn49" id="fnanc49">49</a>
But at last the great inspiring genius of England’s
enemies was defeated, and the long years of war
came to a close in 1815.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
Its effects upon industry, and the working classes</h4>&mdash;When
peace came at length, it found the resources of the
nation sorely tried, but not yet exhausted. All classes
had suffered somewhat, but the working classes worst of
all. The French Revolution, and the consequent wars,
had retarded to some extent the development of our
industries, for it took nearly all the wealth produced by
the new industrial system to pay for them. But in one
thing we possessed a great advantage over Continental
nations, for our island was the only country in which war
was not actually going on, and hence our manufactures
were undisturbed. Consequently England was by no
means so exhausted as the other participants in the
struggle, and she had, moreover, the ocean-carrying trade
left secure to her by our undisputed naval supremacy.
But yet her finances had been tried and stretched to an
enormous extent. The total cost of the war with France
had been £831,446,449, to meet which Pitt was compelled
to turn to almost every expedient that his financial
ingenuity could suggest. Taxation became more and
more heavy, and £600,000,000 was added to the debt
which we have since been engaged in paying off. The
currency had been placed in the most abnormal condition;
cash payments were (in 1797) suspended by the
Bank of England; and it became a necessity,
as soon as <span id="p174" class="xxpn">{174}</span>
the war was over, to put an end to the circulation of a
practically inconvertible paper currency by the resumption
of them in 1819.</div>

<p>But the working classes had suffered the most, in spite
of the fact that our manufactures prospered and exports
increased all through the war. In 1793 the exports were
officially valued at over £17,000,000; for every year afterwards
they were at least £22,000,000, often more; in 1800
over £34,000,000, and in 1815 had quite doubled their
value at the beginning of the war, being then over
£58,000,000 (official value). But the profits all went into
the hands of the capitalist manufacturers, while taxation
fell with special severity upon the poor, since taxes were
placed on every necessity and convenience of daily life.
Even as late as 1841 there were 1200 articles in the
customs tariff. The price of wheat, moreover, rose to
famine height; from 49<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per quarter in 1793, to 69<i>s.</i>
in 1799, to 113<i>s.</i> in 1800, and 106<i>s.</i> in 1810. At the same
time wages were rapidly falling,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn50" id="fnanc50">50</a>
and thus the chief burdens
of the war fell upon those least able to pay for them.
But the poverty of the poor was the wealth of the land-owners,
who kept on raising rents continually and grew
rich upon the starvation of the people; for they persuaded
Parliament to prohibit the importation of foreign
corn except at famine prices (cf. p. <a href="#p200" title="go to p. 200">200</a>), and shifted the
burden of taxation, as was not unnatural, upon other
shoulders. It was owing to their influence that Pitt
raised fresh funds from taxes on articles of trade, manufacture
and general consumption. The result was seen in
the deepening distress of the industrial classes, and in 1816
riots broke out everywhere&mdash;in Kent among the agricultural
labourers, in the Midlands among the
miners, and at <span id="p175" class="xxpn">{175}</span>
Nottingham among the artisans, who wreaked their vengeance
upon the new machines which they thought had
stolen their bread. They should have blamed those who
did not allow them to participate in the wealth they had
helped to create.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Politics among the working classes</h4>&mdash;Such were the
economic effects of the war upon English society&mdash;the enriching
of the capitalists and land-owners at the expense
of the working classes. So dire was the distress of the
workmen that they felt something must be done to make
their voice effectively heard in the government of the
people. William Cobbett, in his <i>Weekly Political Register</i>,
taught them to believe that a reform of Parliament would
cure their evils. The influences of the French Revolution
and the Industrial Revolution also combined to arouse an
active political feeling amongst them; for the former
excited a sympathetic feeling of revolt against unjust
oppression, from what source soever it might come, and the
latter brought home to them in their daily lives the new
and sharp distinctions between the capitalist autocrat
and his hundreds of workpeople bound to him only by a
cash nexus, and as yet powerless to resist his endeavours
to keep down their wages. Indistinctly, but none the
less keenly, the working classes began to feel that they
too must be consulted in the councils of the nation, and as
a preliminary step must gain an influence over political
events. But their early endeavours were sharply and
severely repressed, and the legislation following on the
(so-called) Manchester Massacre of 1819, crushed them
for a time. But the Great War had roused the political
feelings of the masses, by the misery it had inflicted upon
them and by the industrial conditions which it had
brought more fully into play. For although at first it
retarded them, it gave a direct stimulus
to the new <span id="p176" class="xxpn">{176}</span>
manufactures and to the new manufacturing system, by leaving
England the only nation not too exhausted to continue
her commerce. During its progress England had definitely
become the workshop of the world, her industry
had definitely completed its transition from the domestic
to the factory system. Of this system, with its enormous
advantages but also enormous evils, we must now speak.</div>

<div class="section padtopb">
<h3>CHAPTER IV
<span class="hsmall">
THE FACTORY SYSTEM AND ITS RESULTS</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
The results of the introduction of the factory system</h4>&mdash;The
great war of which I have just spoken in the preceding
chapter found England at its beginning a nation
whose mainstay was agriculture, with manufactures increasing,
it is true, but still only of secondary importance.
At the commencement of the war, English workers spun
and wove in their cottages; at its close they were herded
together in factories, and were the servants of machinery.
The capitalist element had become the main feature in
production, and the capitalist manufacturers the main
figures in English industry, rivalling and often overtopping
the landed gentry. But a man cannot become a
capitalist without capital, and capital cannot be accumulated
without labour; though these remarkably obvious
facts are constantly forgotten. The large capitalists of
earlier manufacturing days obtained their capital, after
the first small beginnings, from the wealth produced by
their workmen and from their own acuteness in availing
themselves of new inventions. Of the wealth produced
by their workmen they took nearly the whole, leaving
their employés only enough to live
upon while producing <span id="p177" class="xxpn">{177}</span>
more wealth for their masters. Hence it may be said that
capital was in this case the result of abstinence, though
the abstinence was on the part of the workman and not of
his employer, as we shall shortly see.</div>
</div><!--section-->

<p>This, then, was the immediate result of the factory
system: the growth of large accumulations of capital in
the hands of the new master manufacturers, who with
their new machinery, undisturbed by internal war, were
able to supply the nations of Europe with clothing at a
time when these nations were too much occupied in internecine
conflicts on their own soil to produce food and
clothing for themselves. Even Napoleon, in spite of all
his edicts directed against English trade, was fain to
clothe his soldiers in Yorkshire stuffs when he led them to
Moscow. It was no wonder that the growth of capital
was rapid and enormous. Other results followed. The
formerly widespread cottage industry was now aggregated
into a few districts, nearly all in Lancashire and
Yorkshire. Persons of all ages and both sexes were collected
together in huge buildings, under no moral control,
with no arrangements for the preservation of health,
comfort, or decency. The enormous extension of trade
rendered extra work necessary, and the mills ran all night
long as well as by day. The machines made “to shorten
labour” resulted in many cases in vastly extending it;
while in others again they took away all the means of
livelihood from the old class of hand-workers. Hence
riots frequently occurred, and the labourers sought to
destroy the new machinery; the struggle of what were
called “the iron men” against human beings of flesh and
blood long continued to be a source of controversy and
complaint, more especially as the workmen saw that the
profits made by these iron men went almost entirely into
the hands
of their masters. <span id="p178" class="xxpn">{178}</span></p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Contemporary evidence of the new order of things</h4>&mdash;A
very good idea of the effects of the introduction of the
factory system upon the operatives may be formed from
a resolution unanimously adopted by the magistrates at
the quarter sessions of Preston, in Lancashire, dated
November 11th, 1779, wherein it was “resolved: That
the sole cause of great riots was the new machines
employed in the cotton manufacture: That the county
[<i>i.e.</i> the manufacturers] had greatly benefited by their
erection, and that the destroying them in one county only
led to their erection in another; and that if a total stop
were put by the legislature to their erection in Britain it
would only tend to their establishment in foreign countries,
to the detriment of the trade in Britain.” But
better than the cold words of a formal resolution is the
description of the country round Manchester published
in 1795 by a Dr Aikin. He points out what we have
already referred to, that “the sudden invention and
improvement of machines to shorten labour have had a
surprising influence to extend our trade, and also to call in
hands from all parts, particularly children for the cotton
mills.” He says that domestic life is seriously endangered
by the extensive employment of women and
girls in the mills, for they had become ignorant of all
household duties. “The females are wholly uninstructed
in knitting, sewing, and other domestic affairs
requisite to make them frugal wives and mothers. This
is a very great misfortune to them and to the public, as is
sadly proved by a comparison of the labourers in husbandry,
and those of manufacturers in general. In the
former we meet with neatness, cleanliness, and comfort;
in the latter with filth, rags, and poverty.” He also
mentions the great prevalence of fevers among employés
in cotton mills, consequent upon
the utterly unsanitary <span id="p179" class="xxpn">{179}</span>
conditions under which they laboured. But nowhere
were the evils which accompanied the sudden growth of
wealth and of industry so marked as in the case of those
miserable beings who were brought to labour in the new
mills under the apprentice system. Their life was literally
and without exaggeration simply that of slaves.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
English slavery. The apprentice system</h4>&mdash;When
factories were first built there was a strong repugnance on
the part of parents who had been accustomed to the old
family life under the domestic system to send their
children into these places. It was in fact considered a
disgrace so to do: the epithet of “factory girl” was the
most insulting that could be applied to a young woman,
and girls who had once been in a factory could never find
employment elsewhere. It was not until the wages of
the workman had been reduced to a starvation level
that they consented to their children and wives being
employed in the mills. But the manufacturers wanted
labour by some means or other, and they got it. They
got it from the workhouses. They sent for parish
apprentices from all parts of England, and pretended to
apprentice them to the new employments just introduced.
The mill-owners systematically communicated with the
overseers of the poor, who arranged a day for the inspection
of pauper children. Those chosen by the manufacturer
were then conveyed by wagons or canal boats to
their destination, and from that moment were doomed to
slavery. Sometimes regular traffickers would take the
place of the manufacturer, and transfer a number of
children to a factory district, and there keep them,
generally in some dark cellar, till they could hand them
over to a mill-owner in want of hands, who would come
and examine their height, strength, and bodily capacities,
exactly as did the slave-dealers in
the American markets. <span id="p180" class="xxpn">{180}</span>
After that the children were simply at the mercy of their
owners, nominally as apprentices, but in reality as mere
slaves, who got no wages, and whom it was not worth
while even to feed or clothe properly, because they were
so cheap and their places could be so easily supplied.
It was often arranged by the parish authorities, in order
to get rid of imbeciles, that one idiot should be taken by
the mill-owner with every twenty sane children. The
fate of these unhappy idiots was even worse than that
of the others. The secret of their final end has never
been disclosed, but we can form some idea of their awful
sufferings from the hardships of the other victims to
capitalist greed and cruelty. Their treatment was most
inhuman. The hours of their labour were only limited
by exhaustion after many modes of torture had been
unavailingly applied to force continued work. Children
were often worked <i>sixteen hours</i> a day, by day and by
night. Even Sunday was used as a convenient time to
clean the machinery. The author of <i>The History of the
Factory Movement</i> writes&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn51" id="fnanc51">51</a>: “In stench, in heated rooms,
amid the constant whirling of a thousand wheels, little
fingers and little feet were kept in ceaseless action, forced
into unnatural activity by blows from the heavy hands
and feet of the merciless over-looker, and the infliction of
bodily pain by instruments of punishment invented by
the sharpened ingenuity of insatiable selfishness.” They
were fed upon the coarsest and cheapest food, often with
the same as that served out to the pigs of their master.
They slept by turns and in relays, in filthy beds which
were never cool; for one set of children were sent to
sleep in them as soon as the others had gone off to their
daily or nightly toil. There was often no discrimination
of sexes; and disease, misery and vice
grew as in a <span id="p181" class="xxpn">{181}</span>
hotbed of contagion. Some of these miserable beings tried
to run away. To prevent their doing so, those suspected
of this tendency had irons riveted on their ankles with
long links reaching up to the hips, and were compelled
to work and sleep in these chains, young women and
girls as well as boys suffering this brutal treatment.
Many died and were buried secretly at night in some
desolate spot, lest people should notice the number of the
graves; and many committed suicide. The catalogue of
cruelty and misery is too long to recite here; it may be
read in the <i>Memoirs of Robert Blincoe</i>, himself an apprentice,
or in the pages of the Blue-books of the beginning
of this century, in which even the methodical dry official
language is startled into life by the misery it has to
relate. It is perhaps not well for me to say more about
the subject, for one dares not trust oneself to try and set
down calmly all that might be told about this awful page
in the history of industrial England. I need only remark,
that during this period of unheeded and ghastly suffering
in the mills of our native land, the British philanthropist
was occupying himself with agitating for the relief of the
very largely imaginary woes of negro slaves in other
countries. He of course succeeded in raising the usual
amount of sentiment, and perhaps more than the usual
amount of money on behalf of an inferior and barbaric
race, who have repaid him by relapsing into a contented
indolence and a scarcely concealed savagery which have
gone far to ruin our possessions in the West Indies.
The spectacle of England buying the freedom of
black slaves by riches drawn from the labour of her
white ones, affords an interesting study for the cynical
philosopher.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The beginning of the factory agitation</h4>&mdash;The state
of things in factories where large
numbers of apprentices <span id="p182" class="xxpn">{182}</span>
were employed became so bad, that at last something had
to be done. In 1802 an Act was passed “for the preservation
of the health and morals of apprentices and
others employed in cotton and other mills.” It is a
significant fact, that the immediate cause of this Bill was
the fearful spread through the factory districts of Manchester
of epidemic disease, owing to the overwork,
scanty food, wretched clothing, long hours, bad ventilation,
and overcrowding in unhealthy dwellings of the
workpeople, especially the children. The hours of work
were “reduced” to only 12 per day. This Act, however,
did not apply to children residing near the factory where
they were employed, for they were supposed to be “under
the supervision of their parents.” The result was that,
although the apprentice system was discontinued, other
children came to work in the mills, and were treated
almost as brutally, though luckily they were not entirely
in the hands of their master. But the evils of this system
of child labour were very great. During the whole of
the period of 1800 to 1820, and even to 1840, the results
of their sufferings were seen in the early deaths of the
majority of children and in the crippled and distorted
forms of the majority of those who survived. On the
women and grown-up girls the effects of long hours and
wearisome work were equally disastrous. A curious
inversion of the proper order of things was seen in the
domestic economy of the victims of this cheap labour
system, for women and girls were superseding men in
manufacturing labour, and, in consequence, their husbands
had often to attend, in a shiftless, slovenly fashion,
to those household duties which mothers and daughters
hard at work in the factories were unable to fulfil. Worse
still, mothers and fathers in some cases lived upon the
killing labour of their little children, by
letting them out <span id="p183" class="xxpn">{183}</span>
to hire to manufacturers, who found them cheaper than
their parents.</div>

<p>The factory hands in general, and the children in particular,
at length found help from a few philanthropists
who had not allowed themselves to be dazzled by the
glowing eloquence of the agitators against black slavery.
Lord Ashley, afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury, and Richard
Oastler must in especial be mentioned as the champions
of the mill-hands. Long years after Lord Shaftesbury
had succeeded in his noble work, he spoke of the sad
sights he had seen during his earlier labours in the factory
districts. “Well can I recollect,” he said in a speech
in the House of Lords in 1873, “in the earlier periods of
the factory movement, waiting at the factory gates to see
the children come out, and a set of sad, dejected, cadaverous
creatures they were. In Bradford especially the
proofs of long and cruel toil were most remarkable. The
cripples and distorted forms might be numbered by
hundreds, perhaps by thousands. A friend of mine collected
a vast number together for me; the sight was most
piteous, the deformities incredible. They seemed to me,
such were their crooked shapes, like a mass of crooked
alphabets.” A corroboration of his words is found in one
of Southey’s letters to Mr May (written March 1st, 1833),
in which, speaking of factory labour, he remarked with
justice: “the slave trade is mercy compared to it.”</p>

<p>The companion of the famous Lord Shaftesbury in the
factory agitation was Richard Oastler, who was born in
1789 and died in 1861, and at first, especially in 1807,
was a great supporter of Wilberforce in his anti-slavery
agitation. But, living as he did in the factory districts
of Yorkshire, he discovered a worse slavery existing at
his very doors, and at once decided to do his best to put a
stop to it. From 1829 to 1832 he was the
leader of the <span id="p184" class="xxpn">{184}</span>
movement for a “ten hours day,” and from 1830 to 1847
he devoted himself especially to stopping the oppression
of children in factories, till he caused the Factories
Regulation Acts to be passed. A short reference to
these Factory Acts will not be out of place.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
The various Factory Acts</h4>&mdash;After the Act of 1802
already referred to for improving the condition of apprentices,
an Act for the regulation of work in cotton
mills was passed in 1819, allowing no child to be admitted
into a factory before the age of nine, and placing 12 hours
a day as the limit of work for those between the ages of
nine and sixteen. The day was really one of 13&#x2060;½ or 14
hours, because no meal-times were included in the working
day. Then again in 1831 an Act was passed forbidding
night-work in factories for persons between nine
and twenty-one years of age, while the working day for
persons under eighteen was to be 12 hours a day, and 9
hours on Saturdays. But this legislation only applied
to cotton factories; those engaged in the manufacture
of wool were quite untouched, and matters there were as
bad as ever. But a spirit of agitation was fortunately
abroad in the country. These were the days of the
Reform Bill and of the rise of Trade Unions. These
unions of workmen cried out for the restriction of non-adult
labour to 10 hours a day, and the Conservative
party, who were chiefly interested in the land and not in
the mills, supported them readily against the manufacturers,
who were mainly Liberals and Radicals. The
two most important Acts were those of 1833 and 1847.
That of 1833, introduced by Lord Shaftesbury, prohibited
night-work to persons under eighteen in both
cotton, wool, and other factories; children from nine
to thirteen years of age were not to work more than
48 hours a week, and young persons
from thirteen to <span id="p185" class="xxpn">{185}</span>
eighteen years were to work only 68 hours. Provision
was also made for the children’s attendance at school,
and for the appointment of factory inspectors. These
restrictions in the employment of children led to a great
increase in the use of improved machinery to make up
for the loss of their labour, and it is probable that they
accelerated the use of steam power instead of water power
in the smaller and more old-fashioned mills. Then, after
one or two minor Acts, the famous Ten Hours Bill
(10 Vict. c. 29) was passed in 1847, which reduced the
labour of women and young persons to 10 hours a day,
the legal day being between 5.30 <span class="smmaj">A.M.</span> and 8.30 <span class="smmaj">P.M.</span>
Manufacturers tried to avoid the provisions of this Bill
by working persons thus protected in relays, but this
was stopped by the fixing of a uniform working day in
1850, so that young persons and women could only work
between the hours of 6 <span class="smmaj">A.M.</span> and 6 <span class="smmaj">P.M.</span>, and on Saturdays
only till 2 <span class="smmaj">P.M.</span> Since the passing of these Acts a great
many much needed extensions of their provisions to
other industries have been made, and in 1874 the minimum
age at which a child could be admitted to a factory
was fixed at ten years. The limitation of the labour of
women and young persons necessarily involved the
limitation of men’s labour, because their work could not
be done without female aid. Thus the ten hours day at
last became universal in factories.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
How these Acts were passed</h4>&mdash;It is curious to
notice how these Acts were passed. They all showed the
steady advance of the principle of State interference with
labour; a doctrine most distasteful to the old Ricardian
school of economists, even when that interference was
made in the interests of the physical and moral well-being,
not only of the industrial classes, but of the community
at large. Hence the economists of the
day aided the <span id="p186" class="xxpn">{186}</span>
manufacturers in opposing these Acts to the utmost of
their power, and the laws passed were due to the action
of the Tories and land-owners. Lord Shaftesbury,
Fielden, Oastler, and Sadler were all Tories, though they
were accused of being Socialists. They were supported
by the landed gentry. But the mill-owners had their
revenge afterwards when they helped to repeal the Corn
Laws in spite of the protest of the landlords, who did not
mind the workmen having shorter hours at other people’s
expense, but objected to their having cheap bread at
their own. The working classes cannot fail to observe
that each party was their friend only in so far as they
could injure their opponents, or at least do no harm to
themselves. John Bright especially distinguished himself
(Feb. 10, 1847) by his violent denunciation of the
Ten Hours Bill, which he characterized as “one of the
worst measures ever passed in the shape of an Act of
the legislature.”&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn52" id="fnanc52">52</a>
In 1908 a Coal Mines (Eight Hours)
Bill was passed into law.</div>

<p>But when we look back upon the degradation and
oppression from which the industrial classes were rescued
by this agitation, we can understand why Arnold Toynbee
said so earnestly: “I tremble to think what this country
would have been but for the Factory Acts.” They form
one of the most interesting pages in the history of industry,
for they show how fearful may be the results
of a purely capitalist and competitive industrial system,
unless the wage-earners are in a position to act as an
effectual check upon the greed of an unscrupulous
employer.</p>

<h3 id="p187">CHAPTER V
<span class="hsmall">
THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
Disastrous effects of the new industrial system</h4>&mdash;We
have already seen in various preceding chapters that
the condition of the labourers deteriorated from the time
of Elizabeth onwards, but in the middle of the eighteenth
century it had been materially improved owing to the
increase of wealth from the new agriculture and from the
general growth of foreign trade. But then came the
great Continental wars and the Industrial Revolution;
and it is a sad but significant fact that, although the total
wealth of the nation vastly increased at the end of last
century and the beginning of this, little of that wealth
came into the hands of the labourers, but went mainly
into the hands of the great landlords and new capitalist
manufacturers, or was spent in the enormous expenses
of foreign war. We saw, too, that the labourer felt far
more severely than anyone else the burden of this war,
for taxes had been imposed on almost every article of
consumption, while at the same time the price of wheat
had risen enormously. Moreover, labour was now more
than ever dependent on capital, and the individual
labourer was thoroughly under the heel of his employer.
This, it will be remembered, was the result of the system
of Assessment of Wages (p. <a href="#p107" title="go to p. 107">107</a>), under which the justices
of the peace, including of course chiefly manufacturers
and land-owners, fixed the wages of labour for their own
districts, and fixed them at so low a figure that they had
nearly always to be supplemented out of the rates paid
by the general public. The labourer had
no redress, for <span id="p188" class="xxpn">{188}</span>
all combination in the form now known as Trade Unions
was suppressed, and his condition sank to the lowest
depth of poverty and degradation.</div>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
The allowance system of relief</h4>&mdash;This state of things
was aggravated by various misfortunes. The latter part
of the eighteenth century was marked by almost chronic
scarcity, and after 1790 wheat was rarely below 50<i>s.</i> a
quarter, and often double that price. The famine was
enhanced by the restrictions of the Corn Laws; meanwhile,
population was growing with portentous and
almost inexplicable rapidity. The factories employed
large numbers of hands, but these were chiefly children
whose parents were often compelled to live upon the
labour of their little ones; and the introduction of
machinery had naturally caused a tremendous dislocation
in industry, which could not be expected to right
itself immediately. Poverty was so widespread that, in
1795, the Berkshire justices, in a now famous meeting
at Speenhamland, near Newbury, declared the old
quarter sessions assessment of wages insufficient, besought
employers to give rates more in proportion to the
cost of living, but added that if employers refused to do
this they would make an allowance to every poor family
in accordance with its numbers. This allowance system
succeeded in demoralizing both employers and employed
alike, taking the responsibility of giving decent wages
off the shoulders of the farmers, and putting a premium
upon the incontinence and thriftlessness of the labourers.
This method of relief was general from about 1795 to
1834, in fact until the enactment of the New Poor Law.
Employers of labour, manufacturing as well as agricultural,
put down wages in many parts of the country to
what was simply a starvation point, knowing that an
allowance would be made to the
labourers, upon the <span id="p189" class="xxpn">{189}</span>
magistrates’ orders, out of the poor rates. The wages
actually paid to able-bodied men were frequently only
five or six shillings a week, but relief to the amount
of four, five, six, or seven shillings a week, according
to the size of the man’s family, was given out of the rates.
Such a system could not fail to have a permanently
disastrous influence upon the moral and social condition
of those who suffered from it, taking from them
all self-reliance, all hope, all incentives to improving
their position in life. And as a matter of fact its ill-effects,
especially in agricultural districts, are even yet
apparent.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Restrictions upon labour</h4>&mdash;What made the condition
of the labourers worse still, was the fact that they
could neither go from one place to another to seek work,
nor could they combine in industrial partnership for their
mutual interests. The law of settlement effectually prevented
migration of labourers from one parish to another.
It began with the Statute of 1662, which allowed a pauper
to obtain relief only from that parish where he had his
settlement, “settlement” being defined as forty days’
residence without interruption. There were many variations
and complications of this Statute made in ensuing
reigns, but it remained substantively the same till it was
mitigated by the Poor Law of 1834. The law of settlement
was further strengthened by what are called the
Combination Laws, which prevented workmen from
coming together to deliberate over their various industrial
interests, or to gain a rise in wages. “We have
no Acts of Parliament,” said Adam Smith, with justice,
“against combining to lower the price of work, but
many against combining to raise it.” Elsewhere he
describes the inevitable result of a strike as being
“nothing but the punishment or
ruin of the <span id="p190" class="xxpn">{190}</span>
ringleaders.” The workmen had, of course, no political
influence: they could only show their discontent by
riots and rick-burnings. Yet the time of their deliverance
was at hand.</div>

<p>I have already referred to the sympathy between the
French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. The
former, it is true, frightened our statesmen, but it gave
courage to the working classes, and made them hope
fiercely for freedom. The latter Revolution concentrated
men more and more closely together in large
centres of industry, dissociated them from their employers,
and roused a spirit of antagonism which is inevitable
when both employers and employed alike fail
to recognize the essential identity of their interests.
Now, wherever there are large bodies of men crowded
together there is also a rapid spread of new ideas, new
political enthusiasms, and social activities. And in spite
of the lack of the franchise the artisans of our large towns
made their voices heard; fiercely and roughly, no doubt,
in riot and uproar, but they had no other means. There
were found some statesmen in Parliament, chiefly
disciples of Adam Smith, who gave articulation to the
demands of labour, and owing to their endeavours the
Combination Laws were repealed in 1824. But the
following year proved how insecure was the position of
the labourers without a vote. The employers of labour
were able to induce Parliament in 1825 to stultify itself,
by declaring illegal any <i>action</i> which might result from
those deliberations of workmen which a twelvemonth
before they had legalized. But still they were allowed to
deliberate, strange as it may now seem that permission
was needed for this, and their deliberations materially
aided in passing the Reform Bill of 1832. For as soon
as a class can make its voice heard, even
though it cannot <span id="p191" class="xxpn">{191}</span>
directly act, other classes will take that utterance into
account.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
Growth of Trade Unions</h4>&mdash;But the Reform Bill,
though a great step forward, somewhat belied the hopes
that had roused the enthusiasm of its industrial supporters.
The workmen found that, after all, it merely
threw additional power into the hands of the upper and
middle classes. Their own position was hardly improved.
Then they had to make their voice heard again, and
urged on by the misery and poverty in which they
were still struggling, they demanded the Charter. The
Chartist movement (1838 to 1848) seems to us at the
present time almost ludicrously moderate in its demands.
The vote by ballot, the abolition of property qualifications
for electors, and the payment of parliamentary
members were the main objects of its leaders, though
they asked for universal suffrage as well. Nevertheless
people were frightened, especially when the Chartists
wished to present a monster petition at Westminster on
April 10th, 1848, and military and police intervention
was called in. The movement collapsed, and finally died
away when the repeal of the Corn Laws had restored
prosperity to the nation. Many have laughed at the
working classes for trying to gain some infinitesimal
fraction of political power. But the working classes are
generally acute, and they saw that this was the ultimate
means of material prosperity, nor has the event failed
to justify their belief. In the somewhat quieter times
which followed the collapse of the Chartists, their influence
went on extending, and though the workmen
ceased to agitate they were not idle, but continued
steadily organizing themselves in Trade Unions. These
institutions were not, however, recognized by law till a
Commission was appointed, including
Sir William Erle, <span id="p192" class="xxpn">{192}</span>
Lord Elcho, and Thomas Hughes, to inquire into their
constitution and objects (February, 1867). Their Report
disclosed the existence of intimidation with occasional
outrages&mdash;as was natural when the men had no other way
of giving utterance to their wishes. But Trade Unionism
triumphed. The Unions were legalized in 1871, and
this Act was further extended and amended in 1876.
The old law of master and servant had passed away, and
employer and employed were now on an equal political
footing. It has remained for the men by silent strength
to place themselves on an equal footing in other respects.
Meanwhile the employers entered into a like combination
by forming the National Federation of Employers in 1873,
and the long struggle of the working classes for industrial
freedom did not result in any lessening of the feeling of
class antagonism. But Trade Unions have done much
to gain a greater measure of material prosperity for
the working classes, and to give them a larger share
than formerly in the wealth which the workers have
helped to create. When we look back upon the
last half-century we can only wonder that trade
unionists have been so moderate in their demands,
considering the misery and poverty amidst which they
grew up.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
The working classes fifty years ago</h4>&mdash;For it must
continually be remembered that the condition of the mass
of the people in the first half of this century was one of the
deepest depression. Several writers have commented
upon this, and have taken occasion to remark upon the
great progress in the prosperity of the working classes
since that time. It is true they have progressed since
then, but it has hardly been progress so much as a return
to the state of things about 1760 or 1770. The fact has
been that after the introduction of
the new industrial <span id="p193" class="xxpn">{193}</span>
system the condition of the working classes rapidly declined;
wages were lower and prices were higher; till at
length the lowest depth of poverty was reached about
the beginning of the reign of Queen Victoria. Since then
their condition has been gradually improving, partly
owing to the philanthropic labours of men like Lord
Shaftesbury, still more owing to the combined action of
working men themselves. To quote the expression of
that celebrated statistician, Mr Giffen: “it is a matter
of history that pauperism was nearly breaking down the
country half-a-century ago. The expenditure on poor-law
relief early in the century and down to 1830–31 was
nearly as great at times as it is now. With half the
population in the country that there now is, the burden
of the poor was the same.” The following table will show
the actual figures of English pauperism at a time when
the wealth of the nation was advancing by leaps and
bounds. It will be noticed that the rate was highest in
1818, which was shortly after the close of the great Continental
War, but fell rapidly after 1830, and since 1841
the rate per head of population has not been much more
than six or seven shillings.</div>

<p>But the mere figures of pauperism, significant though
they are, can give no idea of the vast amount of misery
and degradation which the majority
of the working <span id="p194" class="xxpn">{194}</span>
classes suffered. The tale of their sufferings may be read
in the Blue-books and Reports of the various Commissions
which investigated the state of industrial life in the
factories, mines and workshops between 1833 and 1842;
or it may be read in the burning pages of Engels’ <i>State of
the Working Classes in England in 1844</i>, which is little
more than a sympathetic résumé of the facts set forth
in official documents. We hear of children and young
people in factories overworked and beaten as if they were
slaves; of diseases and distortions only found in manufacturing
districts; of filthy, wretched homes where
people huddle together like wild beasts; we hear of girls
and women working underground in the dark recesses of
the coal-mines, dragging loads of coal in cars in places
where no horses could go, and harnessed and crawling
along the subterranean pathways like beasts of burden.
Everywhere we find cruelty and oppression, and in many
cases the workmen were but slaves bound to fulfil their
master’s commands under fear of dismissal and starvation.
Freedom they had in name; freedom to starve
and die; but not freedom to speak, still less to act, as
citizens of a free state. They were often even obliged to
buy their food at exorbitant prices out of their scanty
wages at a shop kept by their employer, where it is needless
to say that they paid the highest possible price for the
worst possible goods. This was rendered possible by the
system of paying workmen in tickets or orders upon certain
shops. It was called “truck”; and has at length
been condemned by English law (1887).</p>

<p>But though as a matter of fact the sufferings of the
working classes were aggravated by the extortions of employers,
and by the partiality of a legislature which forbade
them to take common measures in self-defence, yet
there was one great cause which underlay
all these minor <span id="p195" class="xxpn">{195}</span>
causes, and that was the Continental War which ended in
1815. “Thousands of homes were starved in order to
find the means for the great war, the cost of which was
really supported by the labour of those who toiled on and
earned the wealth that was lavished freely&mdash;and at good
interest for the lenders&mdash;by the Government. The enormous
taxation and the gigantic loans came from the store
of accumulated capital which the employers wrung from
the poor wages of labour, or which the landlords extracted
from the growing gains of their tenants. To outward
appearance the strife was waged by armies and
generals; in reality the resources on which the struggle
was based were the stint and starvation of labour, the
overtaxed and underfed toils of childhood, the underpaid
and uncertain employment of men.”&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn53" id="fnanc53">53</a></p>

<p class="pcontinue">weavers was particularly hard in the years of the great
war, and affords an interesting example of the extortions
of the capitalist manufacturers of the period. For purposes
of comparison I give above the price
of wheat and <span id="p196" class="xxpn">{196}</span>
of weekly wages in the same years; for the price of wheat
forms a useful standard by which to gauge the real value
of wages, even when it is not consumed in large quantities.
It will be seen that wages were at their lowest point just
after the conclusion of the war, while, on the other hand,
wheat was almost at famine prices. After this, however,
and till 1830 the wages of weavers rose again, for the new
spinning machinery had increased the supply of yarn at a
much greater rate than weavers could be found to weave
it, and hence there was an increased demand for weavers,
and they gained proportionately higher wages, the average
for woollen cloth weavers from 1830–45 being 14<i>s.</i> to
17<i>s.</i> a week, and for worsted stuff weavers 11<i>s.</i> to 14<i>s.</i> a
week. But even these rates are miserably low.</p>

<p>The wages of spinners were also very poor, the work
being mostly done by women and children, though when
men are employed they get fairly good pay. The following
table will show clearly the various rates, and it will be
seen that here wages sink steadily till 1845, owing to the
rapid production of the new machinery. The women’s</p>

<p class="pcontinue">wages
exhibit the fall most markedly, the labour of
children being already affected to some extent by the provisions
of the Factory Acts. As for the agricultural
labourer, he too suffered from low wages, the general
average to 1845 being 8<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i> a week, and generally
nearer the former than the latter figure. In fact the
material condition of the working classes
of England was <span id="p197" class="xxpn">{197}</span>
at this time in the lowest depths of poverty and degradation,
and this fact must always be remembered in comparing
the wages of to-day with those of former times.
Some people who ought to know better are very fond of
talking about the “progress of the working classes” in
the last seventy years; and the Jubilees of our late
Queen of course afforded ample opportunity&mdash;of which
full advantage was taken&mdash;for such optimists to talk
statistics. But to compare the wages of labour properly
we must go back more than a hundred years, for seventy
years ago the English workman was passing through a
period of misery which we must devoutly hope, for the
sake of the nation at large, will not occur again. It is
interesting to note, though it is impossible here to go fully
into the subject, that in trades where workmen have combined,
since the repeal of the Conspiracy Laws in 1825
and the alteration in the Act of Settlement,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn54" id="fnanc54">54</a>
wages have
perceptibly risen. Carpenters, masons, and colliers
afford examples of such a rise. But where there has been
no combination it is noteworthy how little wages have
risen in proportion to the increased production of the
modern labourer, and to the higher cost of living, nor does
the workman always receive his due share of the wealth
which he helps to create. Of the results of labour combinations
we shall, however, have something to say in the
final chapter of this little book. But there was one class
of people who happened from various causes to obtain a
very large share of the national wealth, and who grew
rich and flourished while the working classes were almost
starving. In spite of war abroad and poverty at home,
the rents of the land-owners increased, and the agricultural
interest received a stimulus which has resulted in a
very natural reaction. The rise in rents
and the recent <span id="p198" class="xxpn">{198}</span>
depression of modern agriculture will form the subject of
our next chapter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI
<span class="hsmall">
THE RISE AND DEPRESSION OF MODERN AGRICULTURE</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
Services rendered by the great land-owners</h4>&mdash;Although
there have been occasions in our industrial history
when one is compelled to admit that the deeds of the
landed gentry have called for anything but admiration,
we yet must not overlook the great services which this
class rendered to the agricultural interest in the eighteenth
century. I have already mentioned that the development
and the success of English agriculture in the
half-century or more before the Industrial Revolution was
remarkable and extensive; and this success was due to
the efforts of the landlords in introducing new agricultural
methods. They took an entirely new departure
and adopted a new system. It consisted, as I mentioned
before, in getting rid of bare fallows and poor pastures by
substituting root-crops and artificial grasses. The fourfold
or Norfolk rotation of crops was introduced, the
landlords themselves taking an interest in and superintending
the cultivation of their land and making useful
experiments upon it. The number of these experimenting
landlords was very considerable, and in course of
time the tenant farmers followed them, and thus agricultural
knowledge and skill became more and more
widely diffused. The reward of the landlords came
rapidly. They soon found their production of corn
doubled and their general produce trebled. They were
able to exact higher rents, for they
had taught their <span id="p199" class="xxpn">{199}</span>
tenants how to make the land pay better, and of course
claimed a share of the increased profit. About the years
1740–50 the rent of land, according to Jethro Tull, was 7<i>s.</i>
an acre; some twenty years or more afterwards Arthur
Young found the average rent of land to be 10<i>s.</i> an acre,
and thought that in many cases it ought to have been
more. It is probable that the landlord would not have
done so much for agriculture if he had not expected to
make something out of his experiments; but the fact
that he was animated by an enlightened self-interest does
not make his work any the less valuable. The pioneers
of this improved agriculture came from Norfolk, it being
uncertain whether Lord Townshend or Mr Coke, the descendant
of the great Chief Justice, was the first. But
this much is certain: that Lord Lovell, one of the most
distinguished and energetic of the new agricultural school,
found that his profits under the new system were 36 per
cent., as his accounts, still preserved for the year 1731–32,
and a copy of which is extant, bear witness. The new
agriculture indeed brought with it a revolution as important
in its way as the Industrial Revolution.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn55" id="fnanc55">55</a>
One of
the chief features of the change, the enclosures, has been
already commented upon. The enclosure of the common
fields was beneficial, and to a certain extent justifiable,
for the tenants paid rent for them to the lord of the manor.
But it was effected at a great loss to the smaller tenant,
and when his common of pasture was enclosed as well, he
was greatly injured, while the agricultural labourer was
permanently disabled. But it was not unnatural that
enclosures should rapidly be made when farming, and
especially grain-growing, had become so profitable. The
reason for the profits of agriculture at this period we can
now examine.</div>

<div id="p200" class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
The stimulus caused by the Bounties</h4>&mdash;The Government
of the year 1660 had imposed heavy protective
duties upon the importation of grain from abroad, in fact
prohibiting it except when wheat was at famine prices, as
it happened to be in 1662, when it was 62<i>s.</i> 9&#x2060;½<i>d.</i> a quarter,
the ordinary price being 41<i>s.</i> But it did not reach this
price again for many years afterwards. The Government
of 1688, not content with the foregoing protective
measure, added a bounty of 5<i>s.</i> per qr. upon the export
of corn from England. But the effect of this bounty was
not felt for several years, for happily, soon after the passing
of the Bounty Act, a series of plentiful harvests
occurred, and corn was very cheap. There were consequently
loud outcries from the landlords about agricultural
distress, which merely meant that the people at
large were enjoying cheap food. The aim of the bounty
on corn had been to raise prices by encouraging its export,
and thus rendered it scarcer and dearer in England.
As a matter of fact, it had the opposite effect, for it
served as a premium upon which the wheat-grower could
speculate, and thus induced him to sow a larger breadth
of his land with wheat. The premium upon production
caused producers to grow more than the market required,
and so prices fell. Thus, happily for the consumer,
the Corn Laws and the bounty were harmless
during the greater part of the eighteenth century, for
farmers competed one against the other sufficiently to
keep down prices. But the inevitable Nemesis of protective
measures came at the end of the century, when
population was growing with unexampled rapidity and
required all the corn it could get. Then the prices of corn
rose to a famine pitch, while the duty upon its importation
prevented it coming into the country in sufficient
quantities. The landlords received
enormous rents, and <span id="p201" class="xxpn">{201}</span>
the farmers did not mind paying them, for the profits of
both were immense. But meanwhile the mass of the
people was frequently on the verge of starvation, and at
length the country perceived that things could not be
allowed to go on any longer in this way.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn56" id="fnanc56">56</a>
The manufacturing
capitalists of the day supported the leaders of the
people in their agitation, for they hoped that cheap food
might mean low wages. By their aid the landed interest
was overcome, and in 1846 the Corn Laws, by the efforts
of Cobden and his followers, were finally repealed.
Nevertheless the British farmer and his landlords, forgetting,
it seems, the days when they got high prices by
the starvation of the poor, still frequently clamour for the
re-imposition of the incubus of protection.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc56" id="fn56">56</a>
By a law of 1773 importation of foreign wheat was
forbidden as long as English wheat was not more than 48<i>s.</i> per
quarter. In 1791 a duty of 24<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> was imposed as long as English
wheat was less than 50<i>s.</i> a qr.; if English wheat was over 50<i>s.</i>, the
duty was 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The landed interest, however, was not satisfied
yet. In 1804 foreign corn was practically prohibited from importation
if English wheat was less than 63<i>s.</i> a qr.; in 1815 the prohibition
was extended till the price of English wheat was 80<i>s.</i> a qr. Then came
the agitations and riots of 1817–19, after which the country sank into
despair till the formation of the Anti-Corn Law League in 1839.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
Agricultural improvements</h4>&mdash;The high prices
gained by farmers before the repeal of the Corn Laws had,
however, one good effect in increasing the development of
agricultural skill and of agricultural improvements. The
heavy soils of the London clay had at one time been laid
out in pasture lands, as being useless for turnip-growing
or for root-crops. The corn duties, however, caused these
pastures to be broken up for the sake of growing wheat,
barley, and clover; the soil was more thoroughly drained,
and mangolds were grown as a rotation crop,
so that the <span id="p202" class="xxpn">{202}</span>
area of bare fallow was much diminished, while the
quantity of food, both for men and cattle, was much increased.
In recent years much of this very land has
reverted to pasture for dairy-farming. Besides the increase
of the area under wheat, special attention was
given to artificial manures. The use of bones, at first
very roughly broken, became recognized. About 1840–41
dissolved bones and Peruvian guano came into use, particularly
in growing turnips, and these were followed very
soon by mineral phosphates, and more recently by
nitrate of soda and sulphate of ammonia. After the
repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 the prospects of English
agriculture began to look rather gloomy, or at least the
farmers thought so. But the tremendous development
of trade and population, the stimulus given to all kinds of
commerce by the employment of steam, not only for transit
but as a motive power for machinery, had their natural
influence upon agriculture, and the farmer did well. Improved
agricultural machinery came into use, by which
farm work was facilitated, and the outlay for labour was
lessened. Makers of these machines showed great enterprise
and skill, and many altogether new appliances were
placed in the farmer’s hands. Steam power has come to
be used with advantage in digging, stirring and harrowing
the ground, though it has not been such a success in
ploughing. Altogether English agriculture made great
strides, and was quite prosperous in the years 1870–73,
when the general prosperity of the industrial classes was
increasing, and people did not mind paying fairly high
prices for farm produce. But afterwards a period of depression
set in. A succession of bad years, notably the
wet and sunless season of 1879 which ruined many a
farmer, together with excessive rain and deficient sunshine,
most seriously injured
the average harvests. <span id="p203" class="xxpn">{203}</span>
Foreign competition in wheat, imported cattle, and
butchers’ meat largely increased. The price of wheat
fell between 1880 and 1886 from 50<i>s.</i> to 30<i>s.</i> a qr.; between
1884 and 1887 beef fell from 80<i>s.</i> to 55<i>s.</i> per cwt.;
and other produce also fell in proportion. Thousands
of farmers were then ruined, and agriculture generally
suffered a severe and prolonged depression, and much
arable land was then laid down again as pasture, indeed
some went altogether out of cultivation. Meanwhile the
political false prophets were going about with their usual
nostrums, and the flags of Protection and even of Bimetallism
were both waved before the bewildered eyes of
the British farmer, as if they were signals of salvation.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
The cause of the depression. The rise in rent</h4>&mdash;Now
it is perfectly obvious to an impartial observer of
economic facts, that an industry so flourishing as English
agriculture was not very many years ago, could not have
suffered so severe a collapse unless there had been some
great underlying cause, beside the ordinary complaints of
bad harvests and foreign competition. Bad harvests are
not peculiar to England, and foreign competition, however
keen it may be, has first to overstep a very considerable
natural margin of protection in the cost of
carriage. It costs, for instance, according to that great
authority Sir James Caird, 9<i>s.</i> per quarter to transport
American wheat from Chicago to London. It is clear
that besides these, there must have been other influences
of considerable importance, to cause English agriculture
to be, in spite of its apparent prosperity, in so insecure a
position that it should have sunk to the depressed condition
in which it even now remains. We have not to look
far for one cause. It is the lack of agricultural capital.</div>

<p>But how, it may naturally be asked, has it come about
that the English farmer, after the
very favourable period <span id="p204" class="xxpn">{204}</span>
before the depression, should thus suffer from a lack of
capital, a lack which renders it almost impossible for him
to work his land properly? The answer is simple. His
capital has been greatly decreased, surely though not
always slowly, by a tremendous increase in his rent. The
landlords of the eighteenth century made the English
farmer the foremost agriculturist in the world, but their
successors of the nineteenth have raised his rent disproportionately.
Such, at any rate, is the verdict of eminent
agricultural authorities; and the land-owners have been
compelled, for their own sake, to reduce the exorbitant
rents they received a few years ago. Unfortunately, too,
the attention of other classes of the community has been
till lately diverted from the condition of our agriculture
by the prosperity of our manufactures. But these two
branches of industry, the manufacturing and the agricultural,
are closely interdependent, and must suffer or
prosper together.</p>

<p>It is possible, as I have pointed out elsewhere, that
there are certain economic theories which have helped
the decline of English agriculture. They are the Ricardian
theory of rent, and the dubious “law of diminishing
returns.” They have made many people think that this
decline was inevitable, and have diverted their attention
from the prime, though not the only, cause of the trouble&mdash;namely,
the increase of rent. But putting these doubtful
theories aside, we may employ ourselves more profitably
in looking at the facts of the case. I have mentioned
before that in Tull’s time, at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, the average rent of agricultural land was
7<i>s.</i> per acre, and by Young’s time towards the close of the
century it had risen to 10<i>s.</i> per acre. Diffused agricultural
skill caused an increase of profits, and the hope of
sharing in these profits led farmers
to give competitive <span id="p205" class="xxpn">{205}</span>
rents, which afterwards the landlords took care to exact in
full and frequently to increase. The farmers were enabled
to pay higher rents by the low rate of wages paid to
their labourers, a rate which the landed gentry, as justices,
kept down by their assessments. In 1799 we find land
paying nearly 20<i>s.</i> an acre; in 1812 the same land pays
over 25<i>s.</i>; in 1830 again it was still at about 25<i>s.</i>, but by
1850 it had risen to 38<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, which was about four times
Arthur Young’s average. Indeed £2 per acre was not an
uncommon rent for good land a few years ago (1885),&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn57" id="fnanc57">57</a>
the
average increase of English rent being no less than 26&#x2060;½
per cent. between 1854 and 1879. Now such rent as this
was enormous, and could only be paid in very good years.
In ordinary years, and still more in bad years, it was paid
out of the farmer’s capital. This process of payment was
facilitated by the fact that the farmer of this century did
not keep his accounts properly, a fruitful source of
eventual evil frequently commented upon by agricultural
authorities; and also by the other fact, that
even when he perceived that he was working his farm
at a loss, the immediate loss (of some 10 or 15 per
cent.) involved in getting out of his holding was heavy
enough in most cases to induce him to submit to a rise
in his rent, rather than lose visibly so much of his capital.</p>

<p>The invisible process, however, was equally certain, if
not so immediate. The result has been that the average
capital per acre now employed in agriculture is only about
£4 or £5, instead of at least £10 as it ought to be,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn58" id="fnanc58">58</a>
and the
farmer cannot afford to pay for a
sufficient supply of <span id="p206" class="xxpn">{206}</span>
labour, so that the agricultural population is seriously
diminishing. Nothing in modern agriculture is so
serious as this decline of the rural population, and
we must here devote a few words to a consideration
of the agricultural labourer and the conditions of his
existence.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
The labourer and the land. Wages</h4>&mdash;It has been
previously mentioned that the Industrial Revolution was
accompanied by an equally important revolution in agriculture:
the main features of the agrarian revolution being
the consolidation of small into large farms, the introduction
of new methods and machinery, the enclosure of
common fields and waste lands, and discontinuance of
the old open-field system, and finally the divorce of the
labourer from the land. The consolidation of farms reduced
the number of farmers, while the enclosures drove
the labourers off the land, for it became almost impossible
for them to exist on their low wages now that their old
rights of keeping small cattle and geese upon the commons,
of having a bit of land round their cottages, and
other privileges were ruthlessly taken from them. They
have retreated in large numbers into the towns and taken
up other pursuits, or helped to swell the ranks of English
pauperism. Before the Industrial and Agrarian Revolution,
Arthur Young in 1769 estimated that out of a total
population of 8,500,000 the agricultural class, “farmers
(whether freeholders or leaseholders), their servants and
labourers,” numbered no less than 2,800,000&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> over
one-fourth of the total population. The number of those
engaged in manufactures of all kinds he puts at 3,000,000.
His figures may be taken as substantially correct, though
perhaps not as accurate as a modern census. Now let us
look at the agricultural population of to-day. The total
number of males and females
engaged as agricultural <span id="p207" class="xxpn">{207}</span>
wage-earners is only some 689,000&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn59" id="fnanc59">59</a>&mdash;that is, very far
below the numbers so engaged a century ago, while the
proportion has sunk from one person in four to one in
twenty-five concerned in agriculture. At the present
time our fields have on the average only one man to
cultivate twenty-seven acres of land&mdash;and that man is
very badly paid for his trouble, be he farmer or labourer.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc59" id="fn59">59</a>
The figures are for 1901 and represent a fall of thirty per cent.
since 1881.</p></div>

<p>But not only have the numbers of the agricultural
population decreased, but the labourer no longer has any
share as a rule in the land. Certainly the agricultural
labourer, at any rate in the South of England, was much
better off in the middle of the eighteenth century than his
descendants were in the middle of the nineteenth. In
fact in 1850 or so wages were in many places actually
lower than they were in 1750, and in hardly any county
were they higher. But meanwhile almost every necessary
of life, except bread, has increased in cost, and more
especially rent has risen, while on the other hand the
labourer has lost many of his old privileges, for formerly
his common rights, besides providing him with fuel, enabled
him to keep cows or pigs and poultry on the waste,
and sheep on the fallows and stubbles, and he could
generally grow his own vegetables and garden produce.
All these things formed a substantial addition to his
nominal wages. In 1750 or so his nominal wages averaged
8<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i> a week; in 1850 they only averaged 10<i>s.</i>
or 12<i>s.</i>, although in the latter period his nominal wages
represented all he got, while in the former they represented
only part of his total income. Since 1850, however,
even agricultural wages have risen, the present
average being 13<i>s.</i> or 14<i>s.</i> a week. The rise, such as it is,
is due to some extent to Trade Unions,
the leader and <span id="p208" class="xxpn">{208}</span>
promoter of which among agricultural labourers was
Joseph Arch. This remarkable man was born in 1826,
and in his youth and middle age saw the time when agricultural
labour was at its lowest depth. Not only were
wages low, being about 10<i>s.</i> or 11<i>s.</i> a week, but the worst
evils of the factory system of child labour had been transferred
to the life of the fields. The philanthropists seem
to have overlooked the disgraceful conditions of the
system of working in agricultural gangs, under which a
number of children and young persons were collected on
hire from their parents by some overseer or contractor,
who took them about the district at certain seasons of the
year to work on the land of those farmers who wished to
employ them. The persons composing the gang were
exposed to every inclemency of the weather, without
having homes to return to in the evening, people of both
sexes being housed while under their contract in barns,
without any thought of decency or comfort, while the
children often suffered from all the coarse brutalities that
suggested themselves to the overseer of their labour.
Their pay was of course miserable, though gangs flourished
at a time when farmers and landlords were making huge
profits. But the degrading practice of cheap gang-labour
was defended as being necessary to profitable agriculture;
which means that tenants were too cowardly or too
obtuse to resist rents which they could not pay except by
employing pauperized and degraded labour. Amid times
like these Joseph Arch grew up, and it was not till 1872 (at
which time it will be remembered that British farmers
were doing very well) that he began the agitation which
resulted in the formation of the National Agricultural
Labourers’ Union. His difficulties in organizing the
downtrodden labourers were enormous, but he finally
succeeded in spite of the
resentment of agricultural <span id="p209" class="xxpn">{209}</span>
employers. His efforts have already done much to improve
the material condition of the labourers, and wages have
decidedly risen from this and other causes. But they
certainly cannot be called high.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
The present condition of British agriculture</h4>&mdash;It
remains to notice briefly the causes which are now influencing
our agricultural industry, and to point out in
what direction we may expect a revival from the present
state of depression. Besides the great fact of the increase
of rents we notice an increase of foreign competition,
which is of comparatively recent date. Our competitors
are mainly Russia, America, and last but by no
means least, India. At the time of the Crimean War, and
for some years subsequently, Russian competition ceased
to exist. When it began it, standing alone, was not very
serious, for America had not yet entered the field, and
was prevented from doing so by the sanguinary struggles
of the Civil War. High prices for grain prevailed therefore
till some time after America had ceased her internal
conflict, and it was only quite recently that much grain
was grown for export in India. But since 1870 or so
England has been supplied with grain from these three
great agricultural lands, and the English farmer, no
longer buoyed up at the expense of the rest of the community
by protective measures, has found it impossible
to grow wheat at a profit at the old rents. Many farmers
have been ruined; and at Sir James Caird’s estimate (in
1886) the loss of the agricultural classes of all ranks in
spendable income has been nearly £43,000,000 <i>per annum</i>.
According to this well-known authority rents should
therefore have been reduced by £22,800,000 instead of by
much less than half that amount. Even now the aggregate
rental is higher than it was before the Russian war.
In course of time it is certain that the
economic action of <span id="p210" class="xxpn">{210}</span>
supply and demand will bring rents down to something
like their commercial value; meanwhile the English
landlords, as Mr W. E. Bear remarks, have the choice
between allowing their old tenants to be ruined first, and
then accepting reduced rents, or granting reductions soon
enough to save men in whom they have hitherto had
some confidence as tenants. It will be necessary also to
make important changes in the laws and customs of land
tenure, so that our farmers may have complete security
for their capital invested in improvements, and freedom
of enterprise (<i>e.g.</i> in cropping and tilling), in order that
they may do their best with the land. An extended
system of small holdings and allotments, guaranteed by
a thorough measure of Tenant Right, together with free
trade in land as well as other commodities, would do
much to place moderate farms within the reach of industrious
and thrifty yeomen and labourers. Greater
facilities for transit, including the abolition of the essentially
protective system of preferential railway rates,
would enable producers to put their produce with ease
upon the home market, for English food requirements
guarantee an enormous and steady demand at home for
every scrap of food-stuff that the land is capable of producing.
The farmer is slow to adapt himself to changed
conditions, but a profitable future is open to him even if
he gives up wheat-growing and betakes himself more to
dairy-farming and market-gardening. But it may not be
necessary for him to give up wheat, for it seems probable
that the wheat area of the world, except in India, will not
increase; since foreign farmers are beginning to find out
that they cannot put wheat on the English market at the
present low prices. People will see that it is desirable, and
that ultimately it will be profitable, to recall capital and
labour back to the land which it is evident that
it has left; <span id="p211" class="xxpn">{211}</span>
and that it is the height of economic folly to rely, as some
do, upon the extension of our manufacturing industries
to counteract agricultural depression. Prosperous agriculture
means for us prosperous manufactures, and from
an economic point of view the interests of the plough and
the loom are identical. Neither can be served by protective
tinkering. Reforms of a totally different character
are needed, foremost among which is a widespread
reduction of rent, and a general rearrangement of the
relations between landlord and tenant. It is on the face
of it ridiculous to assert that, with an unequalled demand
in the home market for all he can produce, the English
farmer cannot find some means of making the land pay
and pay well. But before he can do this he must spend
more capital upon it than he has lately been able to do.</div>

<h3>CHAPTER VII
<span class="hsmall">
MODERN INDUSTRIAL ENGLAND</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
The growth of our industry</h4>&mdash;We have now traced
the industrial growth of England from the diffused beginnings
of manufactures and agriculture in the isolated
manors, and have seen how gradually towns grew up,
commerce extended and markets arose, while manufacturers
became organized in various centres and
regulated by gilds. We have seen that for several
centuries the back-bone of our national wealth was wool,
but that in time we ceased to export it, and worked it
up into cloth ourselves, thereby gaining great national
wealth. We have seen, too, how our foreign trade, after
its petty beginnings in the Middle Ages, took
a fresh start <span id="p212" class="xxpn">{212}</span>
in the buccaneering days of the Elizabethan sea-captains
and then rapidly developed, by means of the various
great Companies, till England became commercially
supreme throughout the world. From commercial beginnings
we traced the rise of our Indian Empire, and the
growth of the American colonies. Meanwhile at home
there came an Industrial Revolution which, happening
as it did at the moment that was politically most favourable
to its growth, gave England a very useful start over
all other European nations in manufacturing industries
of all kinds, and enabled her to endure successfully the
enormous burdens of the great Continental war. Now
comes a time of still greater progress, economic as well as
commercial, for the old restrictive barriers to trade are
to be swept away, and a new economic policy is to be
inaugurated.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
State of trade in 1820</h4>&mdash;If we now endeavour to
gain some idea of the trade of the country soon after the
war, we may look for a moment at its condition in 1820,
just before Free Trade measures were begun. The official
value of foreign and colonial imports was declared
to be £32,000,000, which with a population of about
21,000,000 was at the rate of about thirty shillings a
head. The exports of home produce amounted to some
£36,000,000. The tonnage of shipping entering and
leaving our harbours was 4,000,000 tons, of which
2,648,000 tons belonged to the United Kingdom and its
dependencies. Steamers were, of course, as yet unknown.
Professor Leone Levi calculates the trade of the country
at not more than one-eighth or one-ninth of what it is at
the present time. The wealth and comfort accessible
to the people in general was much more limited, the consumption
of tea, for instance, being only 1 lb. 4 oz. per
head, and of sugar 18 lbs. a head. In fact,
if we compare <span id="p213" class="xxpn">{213}</span>
the £244,710,066 worth of our exports in 1889–90 with
the £32,000,000 worth in 1820 we see at once how
gigantic has been the growth of our trade. In 1889,
again, the imports (for the first ten months) were
£347,985,087, which is more than nine times their value
in 1820. But even at the beginning of the century
England was far ahead of her old rival France, for French
imports were only worth £8,000,000 in 1815, and her
exports only about double that amount, or less than half
England’s exports, which in that year rose to over
£42,000,000 (official value).</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
The beginnings of Free Trade</h4>&mdash;Now the year 1820
is memorable not merely as showing the condition of our
trade, but for the great enunciation of Free Trade
principles which it witnessed. For in that year the
London merchants formulated a noteworthy Petition
praying that every restrictive regulation of trade, not
imposed on account of the revenue, together with all
duties of a protective character, might be at once repealed.
At last the teachings of economists were being
put into practice by men of business. The Edinburgh
Chamber of Commerce sent up a similar petition; a
Committee was appointed in Parliament to investigate
the wishes of the petitioners of our two capitals; and it
brought in a report thoroughly in agreement with the
Free Trade principles of the merchants. In the following
year Mr Huskisson,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn60" id="fnanc60">60</a>
the President of the Board of Trade,
proposed the first measures of commercial reform, and
one by one the restrictions upon our trade were removed.
The most important of the new measures was the gradual
alteration of the old Navigation Laws (cf. p. <a href="#p130" title="go to p. 130">130</a>), finally
culminating in their total repeal in 1849.</div>

<div class="dftnt">

See more fully note 18, p. <a href="#p251" title="go to p. 251">251.</a></p></div>

<p>It is true that in the period 1821 to
1830 the foreign <span id="p214" class="xxpn">{214}</span>
trade of the United Kingdom did not exhibit much
material improvement, but still there was a steady
increase. The official value of imports rose from
£30,000,000 to £46,000,000, and the value of British
manufactures exported from £40,000,000 to £60,000,000.
But the declared value of exports remained pretty
steady at about £37,000,000. Yet in the United Kingdom
itself trade was growing rapidly, and the increase
of wealth gave an opportunity for a general diminution
of taxes, and our sorely strained finances were set in
order. Many of the injurious duties upon raw materials
and articles of British manufacture&mdash;as <i>e.g.</i> those
on raw silk, coal, glass, paper, and soap&mdash;were taken
off, to the great advantage of our manufacturing
industries.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
Revolution in the means of transit</h4>&mdash;Now, too,
another great industrial revolution was effected. I refer
to the introduction of railways, steam navigation, and
the telegraph, which have done almost as much as the
great inventions of the eighteenth century to revolutionize
the commerce of the world. In 1830 the Liverpool
and Manchester Railway was opened. In 1838
the first ocean passages to New York by steamship were
accomplished by the <i>Great Western</i> from Bristol, and the
<i>Sirius</i> from Cork; although ever since the beginning of
the century small steamers and tugs had been used for
coasting purposes, and on the River Clyde. In 1837
Cooke and Wheatstone patented the needle telegraph,
and the Electric Telegraph Company was formed in
1846 for bringing the new inventions into general use.
In 1840 the penny postage came into operation. Yet
more recently the Suez Canal (1869) has shortened
immensely the distance to the East. It is obvious to all
how incalculably all these
inventions and appliances <span id="p215" class="xxpn">{215}</span>
have aided the development, not only of English trade,
but of the commerce of all the world.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
Modern developments. Our colonies</h4>&mdash;Now I do
not propose, in the limits of a little work like this, to go
into a detailed account of the growth of commerce since
these great modern inventions. There is ample material
for the student in larger works; and the statistics of our
progress may be consulted in the invaluable pages of Mr
Giffen’s and Professor Leone Levi’s books. Here I can
only indicate in the broadest outlines the chief features of
the recent developments of industry. We have followed
the industrial history of England up to a period more
prolific in commercial events, and more remarkable for
commercial progress than any that preceded it. The
experiments and tentative measures of Mr Huskisson and
other statesmen paved the way for a bolder and more
assured policy on the part of subsequent governments,
till at length Sir Robert Peel, urged on by the Anti-Corn
Law League (p. <a href="#p201" title="go to p. 201">201</a>), and stimulated by great famine in
Ireland in 1845, openly adopted the principles of Free
Trade. Under his leadership the Corn Laws were repealed
(1846); the tariff was entirely remodelled, and
the old protective restrictions abolished, Mr Gladstone’s
Budget of 1853 being particularly memorable in this
direction. A great increase of trade followed the
inauguration of the policy which is always associated
with the great name of Cobden,&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn61" id="fnanc61">61</a>
and the wealth of the
country was even further developed. The extension of
the railway system was at the same time a cause and
an effect of this development, and when the great Exhibition
of 1851, the precursor of several others, was held,
England was able to show to all the world her immense
superiority in productive and
manufacturing industries. <span id="p216" class="xxpn">{216}</span>
A further stimulus to trade was supplied by the discovery
of gold in California and Australia (1847–51), which
supplied a much-needed addition to the currency of the
world. Meanwhile, since the war of American Independence,
England had been building up a great colonial
empire, and she had the sense not to attempt again to levy
taxes upon her unwilling offspring. India was taken
over from the East India Company (1858). The colonies
of Canada and the Cape were gained by conquest; those
of Australia and New Zealand were the result of spontaneous
settlement. The two former were captured from
the French and Dutch, but of the second of them at
least we have not made a commercial or even a political
success; nor are we likely to do so unless we can contrive
to keep on good terms with the original settlers, and to
allow no misplaced sentiment about native races to disturb
cordial relations between Europeans. As regards
our Australasian colonies, they have grown far beyond the
expectations of former generations, and gained for themselves
entire political freedom, though they have chosen
to use it chiefly in carrying on a one-sided war of hostile
protective tariffs against their mother-country. As,
however, they owe English capitalists a good deal of
money, the interest on which is paid in colonial goods,
there is a strong commercial bond of union between us
and them; a bond which protectionists in England are
strangely anxious to break, by placing unnatural obstacles
upon the payment in goods of the interest due upon
colonial loans.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
England and other nations’ wars</h4>&mdash;But besides
the extension of our colonial relations, English trade has
benefited by the quarrels of her competitors. The prostration
of Continental nations after 1815 precluded much
competition till almost the middle of
the century, and <span id="p217" class="xxpn">{217}</span>
then the Crimean War broke out (1854–56). As mentioned
before, this war gave a great stimulus to our
agriculture, and had a similar effect upon our manufactures.
The Indian Mutiny which followed it did not
much affect our trade, but it rendered necessary the deposition
of the East India Company and the assumption
of government by the Crown (1858),&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn62" id="fnanc62">62</a>
and thus eventually
served to put our relations to that vast and rich empire
upon a much more satisfactory and profitable basis.
About the same time the Chinese wars of 1842 and 1857,
regrettable as they were, established our commercial
relations with the East generally upon a firm footing,
and since then our trade with Eastern nations has
largely developed. Then came the Civil War in America
(1861–65), after which there was an urgent demand for
English products to replace the waste caused by this
severe conflict. The Civil War was succeeded by a
series of short European wars, chiefly undertaken for the
sake of gaining a frontier, as was the war waged by
Prussia and Austria upon Denmark (1864), followed by
another struggle between the two former allies (1866).
Then in 1870–71 all Europe was shaken by the tremendous
fight between France and Germany, and since
then the Continental nations have occupied themselves
in keeping up an armed peace at an expense almost equal
to that of actual warfare. All their conflicts have
arrested their industrial development, to their own
detriment but to England’s great advantage. Not
content however with that, they increase their difficulties
by a dogged protectionism. As a result, they are far
poorer in general wealth than our own land, and only
succeed in competing with us by means of underpaid
and overworked labour. But the
labourer will not <span id="p218" class="xxpn">{218}</span>
always consent to be overworked and underpaid, and
signs are not wanting that his discontent is fast ripening
into something more dangerous.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
Present difficulties. Commercial depressions</h4>&mdash;But
although English commerce has reached a height of
prosperity considerably above that of other nations, it
has not been and is not now without serious occasional
difficulties. It has been throughout the century visited
at more or less periodic intervals by severe commercial
crises. In the earlier portion of the century they occurred
in the years 1803, –10, –15, –18, –25, and –36; and were
short, sharp, and severe. Since 1837 they have occurred
at regular periods of about ten years, namely in 1847,
–57, –66, –73, and –82; latterly depression has been
most persistent, though with short cessations for special
industries. In the last year or two, however, trade has
again revived, and on the whole we may now (1896) be
said to be enjoying a fair measure of prosperity.</div>

<p>The causes of such depressions in trade are various, and
not always obvious. They are, so to speak, dislocations
of industry, resulting largely from mistaken calculations
on the part of those “captains of industry” whose
<i>raison d’être</i> is their ability to interpret the changing
requirements in the great modern market of the civilized
world. A failure in their calculations, a slight mistake
as to how long the demand for a particular class of goods
will last, or as to the number of those who require them,
results inevitably in a glut in the market, in a case of
what is called (wrongly) “over-production”; and this
is as inevitably followed by a period of depression,
occasionally enlivened by desperate struggles on the part
of some manufacturer to sell his goods at any cost. With
such a huge field as the international market, it is not
to be wondered at that such mistakes are
by no means <span id="p219" class="xxpn">{219}</span>
rare, nor does it seem as if it were possible to avoid them
under the present unorganized and purely competitive
industrial system. They have been aggravated in
England by a belief that our best customers are to be
found in foreign markets, and the importance of a steady,
well established, and well understood home market is
not fully perceived. “A pound of home trade is more
significant to manufacturing industry than thirty shillings
or two pounds of foreign.” Now one of the most
important branches of our home trade must be the
supplying of agriculturists with manufactures in exchange
for food. But when the purchasing power of this class
of the community has sunk as much as £43,000,000 per
annum, it is obvious that such a loss of custom must
seriously affect manufacturers. Again, no small portion
of our home market must consist in the purchases made
by the working classes, yet it does not seem to occur to
capitalist manufacturers that if they pay a large proportion
of the industrial classes the lowest possible wages,
and get them to work the longest possible hours, while
thus obtaining an ever-increasing production of goods,
the question must sooner or later be answered: who is
going to consume the goods thus produced?</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 8.</span>
The present capitalist system. Foreign markets</h4>&mdash;The
answer as far as the capitalist is concerned seems to
be: foreign customers in new markets. English manufacturers
and capitalists have consistently supported that
policy which seemed likely to open up these new markets
to their goods. For a long time, as we saw (p. <a href="#p213" title="go to p. 213">213</a>), they
occupied themselves very wisely in obtaining cheap raw
material by passing enactments actuated by Free Trade
principles and removing protective restrictions. Cheap
raw material having thus been gained, and machinery
having now been developed to such an
extent as to <span id="p220" class="xxpn">{220}</span>
increase production quite incalculably, England sends her
textile and other products all over the world. She seems
to find it necessary to discover fresh markets every
generation or so, in order that her vast output of commodities
may be sold. This policy naturally receives
the approval of those engaged in foreign commerce, and
most of our wars with countries like China, Egypt, or
Burmah, involve commercial interests. But as other
foreign nations are also engaging more widely in external
trade, the international struggle for new markets is
liable to assume at any time a dangerous phase. To-day,
indeed, the industrial history of our country seems to
have reached a point when production under a purely
capitalist system is overreaching itself. It must go on
and on without ceasing, finding or fighting for an outlet
for the wealth produced, lest the whole gigantic system
of international commerce should break down by the
mere weight of its own immensity. Meanwhile, English
manufacturers are complaining of foreign competition in
plaintive tones, which merely means that, whereas they
thought some years ago that they had a complete
monopoly in supplying the requirements of the world,
they are now perceiving that they have not a monopoly
at all, but only a good start, while other nations are
already catching them up in the modern race for wealth.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 9.</span>
Over-production and wages</h4>&mdash;With all this, too, we
hear cries of over-production, a phrase which economically
is meaningless, more especially at a time when a very
large number of people in the civilized world are daily
on the verge of starvation, when the paupers of every
civilized country are numbered by thousands, and plenty
of people who never complain have not enough clothes
to wear and not enough food to eat. Wages are certainly
better than they were fifty years ago, but no
one who knows <span id="p221" class="xxpn">{221}</span>
the facts of the case will deny that for the average
workman&mdash;I
am not speaking of skilled artisans and the <i>élite</i>
of the working classes&mdash;it is practically impossible to save
anything out of his wages against old age or sickness.
It is not the business of a historian to vituperate any
particular class, but he may justly point out the mistakes
to which classes have as a matter of history been
liable. And the great mistake of the capitalist class in
modern times has been to pay too little wages.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn63" id="fnanc63">63</a>
It is an
old agricultural saying&mdash;I believe of Arthur Young’s&mdash;that
one cannot pay too much for good land, or too little
for bad land. The same remark applies to labour.
Capitalist employers rarely make the mistake of paying
too much for bad labour, but they have constantly, as
a matter of history, committed the worse error of paying
too little for good labour. At the beginning of this
century, as I have shown, the coming of the capitalist
and of the capitalist factory system, beneficial as it was
ultimately to England, was followed by a time of unprecedented
misery and poverty for those whom they
employed. The day of the capitalist has come, and he
has made full use of it. The day of the labourer will
come when he has the wisdom, and, we may add, the
self-denial, necessary for a right use of his opportunities.</div>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc63" id="fn63">63</a>
This is now not so true as it was some time ago.</p></div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 10.</span>
The power of labour. Trade Unions and Co-operation</h4>&mdash;But
the labourers of to-day are a very
different class from their ancestors of fifty or seventy
years ago. They have learnt, at least the most advanced
among them, the power of combination, a remedy which
at one time was forbidden them, but which is now fortunately
once more theirs. The steady growth of Trade
Unions and of Co-operative Societies has taught them
habits of self-reliance and of thrift, and
has made them <span id="p222" class="xxpn">{222}</span>
look more closely into the economic conditions of industry.
These unions and societies do not yet embrace
all the workmen of England, but they contain the best
and worthiest of them, and their members are able to
preserve a certain independence in treating with their
employers. The power of capital is now opposed by the
strength of united labour, and some of the great strikes
of recent years have shown how great this united strength
may be. But the power of labour may often in such
cases degenerate into what readily becomes its weakness;
and in any event, the attitude of mutual distrust and
hostility between employer and employed is one which
those who have the best interests of labour at heart
cannot fail to deplore. It is true that the labourer can
look back in his history to times when the power of his
employer was used too selfishly and he himself was
miserably oppressed. The miseries of the early days of
the Industrial Revolution, the pauperism of agricultural
labour in the early days of the nineteenth century, the
sad conditions of children’s employment at the beginning
of Queen Victoria’s reign&mdash;all these show how the
greed of gain has rendered masters callous to their workpeople’s
welfare. But it must be remembered also that
in many cases the workpeople themselves were by no
means always anxious for the improvement of these conditions;
and both masters and men have been slow to
recognize the essential identity of interest, and the equal
rights, of Capital and Labour. If the great principle
of mutual interest and co-operation between employer
and employed were more fully acted upon, then the
industrial history of our country would enter upon a new
era of well-founded prosperity.</div>

<div class="section padtopb">
<h3 id="p223">CHAPTER VIII
<span class="hsmall">
THE NEW AGE, 1897–1911</span></h3>

<div class="dh4first"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 1.</span>
Industrial Expansion</h4>&mdash;It is impossible in the compass
of a brief chapter to deal otherwise than in the
barest outline with the industrial developments of the
last fourteen years. The period opens with the Diamond
Jubilee of Queen Victoria, includes the whole reign of her
son, King Edward the Seventh, and closes in the Coronation
year of her grandson, George the Fifth. From one
point of view the country has during this time made
marvellous advances in general prosperity. The population,
indeed, which according to the returns of 1911
stands at the figure of 36,075,269 for England and Wales,
shows a slower rate of progress than for any other
decennial period since the institution of the census in
1801; but in so far as the diminished birth-rate is due
to a higher standard of living among the people, such a
slackening is itself a token of material well-being. And
judging by the ordinarily accepted standards neither the
accumulated wealth nor the productivity of our nation
has ever before attained so great a height.</div>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The gross amount of income brought under the survey
of the Inland Revenue Department in 1907–08 (the last
year for which returns are available) amounted for the
first time to over £1,000,000,000 sterling, while the net
amount available for taxation was over £693,000,000 as
against £525,000,000 in 1897–98. The public applications
for capital registered in London in the year 1910 reached
a total of £267,439,100, a vast sum which exceeds all
previous records by more than £75,000,000, and (apart
from the large number of
unrecorded private investments) <span id="p224" class="xxpn">{224}</span>
shows the prosperity of undertakings at home and the
amount of surplus capital available for investment abroad.</p>

<p>Wages also, which declined from 1901 to 1905, yet show
a marked increase over the whole period under review,
though this increase is unfortunately largely nominal,
owing to the contemporaneous rise in prices and house-rent.</p>

<p>Both shipping and railway transport have undergone
a vast expansion: the statistics for inland traffic are the
chief among our few data regarding the advance of home
trade. Foreign trade, which the “man in the street”
has been led by recent controversy to take as the main
criterion of industrial progress, after breaking all previous
records in 1907, again surpassed itself in 1910. Our total
imports for that year were £678,440,173, and our exports
of British produce amounted to £430,589,811. A comparison
with 1897, when the value of our imports was
£451,028,960 and of our exports £294,174,118, shows how
remarkable has been the increase in the volume of our
foreign trade. A noteworthy feature is the growth in the
re-export figures, which in 1910 for the first time exceeded
£100,000,000, thus testifying to the maintenance
of our position as the great carrier and transport agent
for the world.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 2.</span>
Wars, calamities, and the American crisis</h4>&mdash;Yet
there is another side to this picture of progress and well-being.
During the same period the various quarters of
the world were visited by a long series of calamities, both
natural and artificial, from which our own dominions were
not exempt. The Spanish-American War of 1898, the
Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, and the disastrous earthquakes
at San Francisco (1906), Jamaica (1907), and
Messina (1908) all caused not only loss of life and great
physical suffering, but widespread destruction of capital,
the effects of which were felt in
all industrial countries. <span id="p225" class="xxpn">{225}</span>
In the earlier years of the period plague and famine in
India and a succession of serious droughts in Australia
also checked the productive capacity and purchasing
power of these great dependencies, and consequently
affected our industries at home.</div>

<p>But the closest and most malign influence was that
of the South African War (1899–1903), which, after at
first giving an apparent impetus to the trades supplying
munitions of war, left behind it a legacy of debt, increased
military and naval expenditure, and widespread
depression in trade, with consequent unemployment
during the “lean years” that followed. The National
Debt in 1898–99, before the outbreak of war, stood at
£638,000,000, but had risen by 1903–04 to £798,000,000,
or to the level of 1870, thus wiping out in four years the
laborious debt reductions of more than thirty years.</p>

<p>After some years of depression trade again revived, and
throughout the world 1907 was a year of abnormally
high prices and widespread speculation, which culminated
during the autumn in an acute financial crisis in the
United States. There practically all the banks suspended
cash payments for some months. The effects of
this shock to credit were felt far and wide. Vast quantities
of gold were shipped to the United States, and
although London at the time stood the strain much
better than any other financial centre, the Bank of
England was forced to raise its rate of discount to seven
per cent. In the following year the United States and
Japan still suffered from commercial depression, and in
India the harvest proved a failure. Hence, as the consuming
power of these great areas was checked, their
demand for British goods fell off. Thus the volume of
our foreign trade was greatly reduced and the average of
the monthly unemployment returns by
the Trade Unions <span id="p226" class="xxpn">{226}</span>
for 1908 was far the highest for many years past, being
9·1 per cent., as against 4·3 in the preceding year.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 3.</span>
The increase of public expenditure</h4>&mdash;During the
Boer War and since its close there has been an unparalleled
growth both in national and municipal expenditure. For
every £5 that was required by public departments in 1895
£8 is now expended. The addition to the National Debt,
and consequently to the debt charges, has been already
noticed, and the following table shows the general figures
for the opening and close of the period under review:&mdash;</div>

<p>These totals represent an expenditure per head of the
total population of £2, 11<i>s.</i> in 1897–98 and of £3, 16<i>s.</i> in
1910–11.</p>

<p>We must remember, however, that the expenses of the
Post Office are more than covered by the revenue derived
from that institution, and that much of the addition
to the Civil Service estimates is due to Old Age
Pensions and to the increased provision for education.
“The Civil Service charge has risen as the natural result
of multiplied and enlarged activities, and advance has
been specially heavy in the last two decades, but the
Civil Service includes education, poor law, the improvement
of roads and health, and many other services which
conduce to national well-being. It stands on a very
different economic level from
armaments, which represent <span id="p227" class="xxpn">{227}</span>
the workings of international discord and jealousy.”&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn64" id="fnanc64">64</a>
Yet there is no doubt that in all departments the public
money is being expended more freely and extravagantly
than was the case some twenty-five years ago.</p>

<p>The portentous increase in naval expenditure must be
ascribed partly to the Boer War, but chiefly to our recent
rivalry in naval construction with Germany, and our
adoption of the <i>Dreadnought</i> type of battleship. Army
expenditure increased between 1897 and 1899 through a
series of “little wars” in Egypt and India, and since the
South African War we have been practically maintaining
a war establishment in time of peace.</p>

<p>Thus we see that owing to the growth of armaments
and fresh expenditure on social needs the taxpayer has
to endure a heavy burden, which threatens to grow as
the rate of increase among the population slackens. Any
expenditure beyond what is required for military efficiency
and social well-being is not only wasteful but
actually injurious to our industry and commerce, since
it diverts capital from productive channels. There is no
justification for maintaining taxation at a war level in
time of peace. As Mr Gladstone said, money is best left
to fructify in the pockets of the people; or, to quote his
great opponent, Lord Beaconsfield, who was always in
agreement with him on this point, “the more you reduce
the burdens of the people in time of peace, the greater
will be your strength when the hour of peril comes.”</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 4.</span>
Free Trade and Protection. The Colonies</h4>&mdash;Ever
since the repeal of the Corn Laws there had been in England
a group of agricultural Protectionists, and some
thirty years ago a small number of manufacturers began
to advocate retaliation against foreign tariffs under the
title of “Fair Trade.” Towards the close of Queen <span id="p228" class="xxpn">{228}</span>
Victoria’s reign the growth of Imperial sentiment brought
into prominence suggestions for a closer political and
commercial union between England and her colonies.
In 1903 these various strands of thought were combined
by Mr Joseph Chamberlain, then Colonial Secretary, in
his campaign on behalf of “Tariff Reform.” This movement
(which thus at first contained the inconsistent
elements of protection to the British farmer, retaliation
against the foreign manufacturer, and colonial preference)
met with some acceptance in that year of depressed
trade, and has now been adopted as the programme of the
Unionist Party, in spite of the opposition of an important
minority. In the General Election of 1906 the Protectionists
sustained a crushing defeat, and they have not
since been able to secure a majority in the House of
Commons.</div>

<p>Although the controversy is still unsettled, it is at
present, for various reasons, somewhat in abeyance.
Old Age Pensions, which were to have been provided out
of the revenues of the tariff, have been granted without
recourse to protection, and other questions have occupied
the political field at home, while the recent great expansion
both in home and foreign trade seems, in the eyes
of the public, to have falsified the more gloomy predictions
of the “Tariff Reformers.”</p>

<p>The supporters of the movement emphasize the growing
political and commercial importance of our colonies, and
the rapid advances made by Germany and the United
States in neutral markets, and they point to the tariff
walls which block our trade with foreign nations. Free-traders,
in reply, maintain that the progress of Germany
and America is due to a combination of many causes
apart from their tariffs. They are, for purposes of
internal trade, the largest free trade areas
in the world. <span id="p229" class="xxpn">{229}</span>
Since the trade of nations is mutually interdependent we
cannot suffer from an increase in commercial prosperity
elsewhere, and retaliation has never proved a successful
method of fighting hostile tariffs. In conclusion, they
declare that an impossible task awaits any statesman
who undertakes to frame a British tariff satisfactory
alike to farmer, manufacturer, the colonies and India,
and one which would not involve an increase in the price
of food and other necessaries.</p>

<p>The reader must refer to larger treatises for details of
the controversy, which has been much embittered by
party spirit. But it seems at least that the war of
statistics and arguments has not proved that the position
of the working classes in regard to real wages, continuity
of employment, and conditions of labour is better in
protected countries than among our own people: indeed,
as skilled economists constantly remind us, so
many other factors are involved and so many qualifications
must be made that it is almost impossible to draw
trustworthy comparisons of this nature. Nor has the
response of the colonies to the suggestions of the Preferentialists
been encouraging. They have shown without
ambiguity that highly as they value their connexion
with the mother-country, they value equally highly their
own political and commercial independence. In 1901
the various States of Australia united in a Federal Commonwealth
whose tariff is highly protective, and in 1911
Canada began to negotiate mutual tariff concessions
with the United States, her nearest and most important
market. Our colonies are thus rapidly developing into
practically independent States, bound to us, indeed, by
ties of filial affection and interest, but determined to
shape their own careers. South Africa has just entered
upon the most hopeful chapter of
her chequered history <span id="p230" class="xxpn">{230}</span>
by the federation of the four colonies in the Union of
South Africa. The original settlements of Cape Colony
and Natal and the two Boer States conquered in the late
war form now a self-governing whole&mdash;a happy reconciliation,
hardly to have been anticipated at the end of
the war, which is a high tribute to the wisdom of statesmen
at home and to the healing effects of time in South
Africa.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 5.</span>
The position of the workers. Social legislation</h4>&mdash;Returns
recently published by the Local Government
Board and other official statistics show that in the last
half-century there has been a very marked improvement
in regard to public health and social conditions. The rate
of infantile mortality (among children less than one year
old) is still sadly high in many town areas, yet, though
it stood in 1907 at 118 per thousand for the whole of
England and Wales, this figure is lower than that for any
Continental country except Holland, and the death-rates
from many diseases have also fallen rapidly in recent
years. Housing accommodation has improved, statistics
of overcrowding in 1901 showing a considerable reduction
upon those of the previous census, and pauperism
has on the average steadily declined. Wage statistics
are inadequate and very difficult of interpretation, but
they seem to indicate a marked rise during the last
forty years, while the level of prices has fallen 24 per
cent. during the same period. A detailed consideration
of the last five years, however, reveals a less cheerful
picture. The depression of trade resulting from the expenditure
of capital during the South African War led to
a fall in wages and a serious increase in unemployment.
The hardships of the workers were aggravated by a
period of rising prices and by the reflex effects of the
American crisis. The statistics of pauperism
in 1907 and <span id="p231" class="xxpn">{231}</span>
1908 showed a proportion of 24 per thousand inhabitants
against an average of 22 per thousand for the preceding
decade. In October and November 1908 the Trade
Unions returned 9 per cent. of their members as unemployed,
whilst amongst unorganized and casual workers
the proportion was no doubt higher.</div>

<p>Yet at the same time there is a greatly increased sensitiveness
of the public conscience regarding the condition
of the vast majority of the population, as has been shown
both in Parliamentary legislation and in unofficial movements
for social betterment. Among the latter, garden
villages and schemes for housing and town-planning bear
witness to a recognition by employers and municipalities
of a duty to provide workers and their families with some
of the necessities for “good life.”&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn65" id="fnanc65">65</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc65" id="fn65">65</a>
“The State came into being to preserve life, but it continues
in being for the sake of good
life.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">A<b>RISTOTLE.</b></span></p></div>

<p>Such questions have become all the more urgent with
the recent rapid growth of great suburban districts on
the borders of our cities. This phenomenon&mdash;due to the
eagerness of workers to escape into regions of somewhat
purer air and lower rates outside the municipal areas&mdash;is
emphasized in the latest census returns. According to
these the boroughs are actually increasing in population
less rapidly than their neighbouring counties, and in
London itself the overflow is shown by decreases in many
of the boroughs and an increase of 33 per cent. in the
“Outer Ring.”</p>

<p>In another direction the success of the Workers’
Educational Association and kindred efforts proves that
many among the working classes are eager to grasp opportunities
for intellectual growth. But it is in recent legislation
that we find the most remarkable testimony both
to the power of the labour movement
and the awakened <span id="p232" class="xxpn">{232}</span>
national conscience to which allusion has just been
made.</p>

<p>There was an attempt in 1907 to check the drift townwards
by offering the labourer an inducement to remain
in the country. The aim of the Small Holdings and
Allotments Act of that year was to provide him with a
few acres of land at a reasonable rate with security of
tenure, and so to re-establish the small cultivator. The
Budgets from 1906 to 1908 not only relieved the general
taxpayer by debt reduction and the middle classes by a
differentiation of the income-tax in favour of earned
incomes, but also reduced the tea and sugar duties, which
fall most heavily on the working classes. But the Budget
of 1908 will be remembered chiefly for the step then
taken towards the relief of the aged poor. The institution
of Old Age Pensions (already in force for some years
in our Australasian colonies) was hotly decried as a
Socialistic measure debasing to the recipients. So far,
however, the test of experience seems to show none but
good results, and since the recent removal of the poor
relief disqualification there has been a marked fall in the
statistics of pauperism. In 1909 the new Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Mr Lloyd-George, introduced his first
Budget. Its rejection by the House of Lords, which
marked the crisis of the long struggle between the two
Houses, has made it famous in constitutional history. But,
avoiding its controversial clauses, we may note that this
Budget also provided a small sum for the establishment
of Labour Exchanges, on the Continental model, throughout
the country. These exchanges, which are now working,
aim at rendering labour more mobile, at bringing
employers requiring workers and workers needing employment
into touch with one another, and at publishing
reliable information as to the condition
of the labour <span id="p233" class="xxpn">{233}</span>
market. The Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1897,
which placed the liability for industrial accidents on the
shoulders of employers, was extended in 1906 to all
workers (including domestic servants) whose annual
earnings are under £250. Lastly, in 1911, a far-reaching
scheme was introduced by which, with State assistance,
all wage-earners (under a maximum of £160 per annum)
are to be insured against sickness (including for women
a maternity benefit) and the experiment of an insurance
against unemployment is to be tried in the case of building,
shipbuilding, and engineering&mdash;the trades which
suffer most acutely from periodical lack of work.</p>

<p>We may also notice here the publication in 1909 of the
exhaustive Report of the Poor Law Commission appointed
in 1905. This is noteworthy both for its wholesale
condemnation of the existing poor law system and its
drastic proposals for a new method of dealing with the
problem of poverty and unemployment. Four Commissioners,
led by Mrs Sidney Webb, the well-known
social writer, published their own “Minority” report,
which contains a still more far-reaching scheme of State
control. Both reports have aroused keen interest, they
have influenced some of the legislation just described,
and one of the schemes or a compromise between them
will no doubt form the basis for the expected reform of
the Poor Law.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 6.</span>
Trade Unionism and the Labour Movement</h4>&mdash;It was
remarked in the last paragraph that the social legislation
recorded was due in part to the pressure of the organized
forces of labour upon politicians. The membership of
Trade Unions has risen from 1,688,531 in 1898 to
2,426,592 in 1910; while in Parliament the Labour
Party consisted in 1911 of about forty members, the
majority of whom were nominated by
Trade Unions and <span id="p234" class="xxpn">{234}</span>
maintained out of Trade Union funds. Through these
representatives Trade Unionists have been able to exert
a considerable influence upon legislation. By the decision,
on appeal, of the House of Lords, in the Taff Vale
Case (1901), the Trade Unions Act of 1871 was so interpreted
as to make it possible for a Trade Union to be sued
in tort for the acts of its members, and for Trade Union
funds to become liable for any damages that might be
awarded. Trade Unionists protested against the decision
as contrary to the spirit of the legislation of 1871, and
sufficient pressure was exerted by the Labour members
to ensure the passage of the Trade Disputes Act in 1906.
This restored Trade Unions to their original position
under the law of 1871.</div>

<p>But in 1909 the “Osborne Judgment” struck a blow
at the existence of the Labour Party itself. Osborne, a
member of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants,
sued the officials of that union on the ground that
the enforced levy from members for the maintenance of
Parliamentary representatives was <i>ultra vires</i> and accordingly
void. After prolonged litigation the House of
Lords gave its final judgment in favour of the plaintiff.
The Labour Party in Parliament began to press for the
reversal of this decision, and at the same time tried to
conciliate opposition by abolishing the “pledge” to
which all its members had been forced to subscribe.
But the obvious difficulties which handicapped men of
moderate means, of whatever party, in their attempts to
enter Parliament, led to another movement amongst
Liberals, Labour Members, and some Conservatives for
the payment of all Members of Parliament out of State
funds, and provision for this step was made in the Budget
of 1911.</p>

<p>Of recent years there has been
considerable unrest in <span id="p235" class="xxpn">{235}</span>
the labour world and much loss of time and money has
accrued to both employers and employed through industrial
disputes. The most important stoppages were
those in the coal trade (in South Wales in 1898 and 1910
and in the North in 1910), in the Lancashire cotton industry
in 1908 and 1910, in the engineering centres on
the north-east coast in 1908, and in the shipbuilding
trade in 1910. In August 1911 the country had to face
stoppages at the London and Liverpool docks, and,
closely following, a general railway strike, which occurred
at twenty-four hours’ notice. The dockers gained their
demands; the railway strike, through the efforts of the
Government, only lasted two days, as a small and impartial
Commission was immediately appointed to inquire
into the working of the Railway Conciliation
Boards, the inefficiency of which to remedy grievances
was put forward by the railway unions as the cause of
the strike. These recent transport difficulties occasioned
very serious trade losses and much inconvenience to the
general public, and in certain parts of the country were
attended by grave rioting and disorder. All the disputes
have taxed the powers of skilled arbitrators (Board of
Trade officials or distinguished private individuals), but
their most disquieting feature has been, in several cases,
the tendency of the workers not to comply with the terms
of settlement, and the apparent inability of Trade Union
officials to enforce such compliance. Action of this kind
can only have the effect of alienating popular sympathy
even in the case of genuine grievances. However, it is
admitted by most observers that the recent increase in
the prices of important commodities and the general rise
in the standard of life amongst the working classes make
the claim for higher wages and shorter hours of work a
well-founded one.</p>

<div id="p236" class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">§ 7.</span>
Recent inventions and industrial developments</h4>&mdash;With
regard to industrial machinery recent years have
shown rather a greater perfection and rapidity of
working than any actually new invention. Perhaps
the greatest technical improvements have been made
in engineering and steel production, but in many
branches of industry the part of the machine constantly
increases in importance and that of the individual worker
diminishes.</div>

<p>The most striking developments of the last fifteen
years have been in connection with transport and communication.
The telephone has become a business necessity,
and now wireless telegraphy (associated with the
name of M. Marconi) has extended our power of rapid
intercourse even to mid-ocean. There has been an
enormous increase in the size and speed of merchant
vessels, the most sensational evidence of which is seen
in the vast ocean liners of German and Anglo-American
companies plying between Europe and the United
States.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn66" id="fnanc66">66</a>
Not only have these ships reduced the passage
between New York and Liverpool to a length of about
five days, but they are able to carry much larger cargoes
than their predecessors, and thus doubly tend to swell the
volume of international trade. On land there has been
an extraordinary increase in the use of motor transport
both for goods and passenger traffic, and the recent
successes of aviation seem to foretell that at no distant
time the air will form another highway for human intercourse.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc66" id="fn66">66</a>
The <i>Lusitania</i> and <i>Mauretania</i> are over
31,000 tons burden; the <i>Olympic</i> and the <i>Titanic</i>, 45,000
tons.</p></div>

<p>Glancing at the changes in the industrial world we
may note the tendency (due to resultant economies of
marketing and management) towards an increase in the <span id="p237" class="xxpn">{237}</span>
size of a single business and in the amount of capital
invested in it. This tendency is seen in many of the
great staple manufactures, such as the textile trades and
milling, but also in banking and finance generally, where
the huge joint-stock concerns with many branches have
swallowed up the old-fashioned private bank with its
local connexion. In retail trading, too, the great stores,
providing many classes of goods under one roof, prove
formidable rivals to the small shopkeepers. These stores
are generally run as joint-stock companies and often have
branches throughout the country. Nevertheless, thanks
mainly to the absence of a protective tariff, which shelters
the growth of monopoly, England is comparatively free
from the dominance of great Trusts. Some partial or
local monopolies exist, of which railways, newspaper
combines, and the “tied” public-houses attached to some
brewing companies form the most obvious examples.
But in the opinion of those qualified to judge, the small
trader or manufacturer is holding his own in many
branches of industry.</p>

<p>The census returns, which show the shifting of employment
in various groups of industry, form a good criterion
of their relative importance. Those for 1901 have been
analysed as follows by a recent writer:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The orders which show the greatest decline are
textiles and dress. While metal, ships, pottery, wood,
food, etc., show a moderate advance, precious metals and
instruments, vehicles, chemicals, printing, show a great
increase. A still closer examination into the sub-orders
of the census returns shows that the foundational and
the staple processes of manufacture are stagnant or
declining in importance, while those concerned with the
finishing processes of manufacture,
especially those <span id="p238" class="xxpn">{238}</span>
concerned with the manufacture of more highly specialized
articles, are increasing.”&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn67" id="fnanc67">67</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Hobson adds that the most noteworthy advance is
shown in two special groups, the trades concerned with
the building and furnishing of houses and those which
manufacture vehicles for land and water carriage. The
growth in the first of these groups tends to corroborate
the statistics of improved housing accommodation
already mentioned, while that in the second introduces
us to the most significant movement of all, the enormous
increase in all occupations connected with land and water
transport. This again may be correlated with the figures
for our re-export trade already given, since both show
England’s marvellous position as the great market and
carrier for the world.</p>

factors in history">
<span class="nowrap">§ 8.&#xfeff;<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn68" id="fnanc68">‡</a></span>
The necessity of studying economic factors in
history</h4>&mdash;Hitherto our prosperity, great as it is, has
frequently had its drawbacks, and has passed through
many vicissitudes. Our ancestors and ourselves have
made many mistakes, and till recently, as we have seen,
the growth of our national wealth has been slow. But
a study of industrial history is not without its uses, if
it helps us to-day to understand how we have come into
our present position, and what faults and follies we must
avoid in order to retain it. Unfortunately, few historians
have thought it worth their while to study
seriously the economic factors in the history of nations.
They have contented themselves with the intrigues and
amusements of courtiers and kings, the actions of individual
statesmen, or the destructive feats of military
heroes. They have often failed to explain properly the
great causes which necessitated the
results they claim <span id="p239" class="xxpn">{239}</span>
to investigate. But just as it is impossible to understand
the growth of England without a proper appreciation
of the social and industrial events which rendered
that growth possible, and which provided the expenses
which that growth entailed, so it will be impossible to
proceed in the future without a systematic study of
economic and industrial affairs. Many of the great
political questions of our day derive most of their
difficulty from economic causes; while international
politics tend more and more to centre round matters of
commercial and industrial importance. After all, the
means by which we gain our daily bread form for the
majority of mankind the most pressing of problems;
and what is true of the individual is true on a larger scale
of the nation also. Man is by no means a purely economic
animal, but the material wants of human life must be
satisfied, and much of human activity must be directed
toward their fulfilment. The history of mankind is the
history of man’s activity, and so long as human nature
and men’s material conditions are what they are, so long
must economic and industrial factors have a potent
influence in the course of political and social life. We
have seen in these pages how such factors have influenced
the growth of our own nation and contributed towards
bringing us into our present position; and it is only
reasonable to believe that commercial and industrial
considerations must weigh more and more heavily with us
if that position is to be secured and maintained. And
those of us who wish to help in maintaining and advancing
our national progress must seek carefully to answer the
economic questions that are forcing themselves continually
upon us, by looking at them in the light afforded by
the industrial history of a great industrial nation.</div>

<h3>NOTE ON AUTHORITIES FOR INDUSTRIAL HISTORY</h3>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="spbigcap">F</span>or
the earlier periods of English industrial history the ordinary
student will find Cunningham’s <i>Growth of Industry</i> and Ashley’s
<i>Introduction to English Economic History and Theory</i> useful. Besides
these he should endeavour by all means to read the <i>Domesday
Book</i>, a translation or copy of which may be found in most
public libraries. The well-known histories of Stubbs and Freeman
are also a great help. Then, for the whole of the period from
Henry III. to the eighteenth century, the large work, <i>The History
of English Agriculture and Prices</i> (in six volumes) by Professor
Thorold Rogers affords a perfect mine of information. The same
author’s <i>Six Centuries of Work and Wages</i> and <i>Economic Interpretation
of History</i> are absolutely indispensable for anyone who
wants to understand, not only our industrial, but our general
history. Time spent over these two books is amply repaid.
For the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries especially, Toynbee’s
<i>Industrial Revolution</i> and Leone Levi’s <i>History of Commerce</i> must
be read, and the Blue-books of the period should also be consulted.</p>

<p>Besides these works by modern authors, Arthur Young’s
<i>Northern and Southern Tours in England</i>, and Defoe’s <i>Tour</i> afford
a valuable picture of English industries in the last century, as also
does the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> by Adam Smith. There is likewise a
useful little <i>History of British Commerce</i>, from the earliest times,
by G. L. Craik (published in 1844 by Charles Knight, but now
long since out of print), which I have found very helpful and
fairly complete.</p>

<p>For the political portion of our history Green’s <i>History of the
English People</i> will probably be sufficient for general readers; and
it contains occasionally a reference to industrial events. Mr
George Howell’s <i>Conflict of Capital and Labour</i> should be read,
as affording a clear view of the old gilds and their modern
descendants, the Trade Unions; and no student of modern
industrial questions should omit to familiarize
himself with the <span id="p242" class="xxpn">{242}</span>
<i>History of Co-operation</i>, by Mr Holyoake. A little book called
<i>The Romance of Trade</i> gives a number of interesting industrial
facts in a disconnected sort of way, and may be read with advantage
when the student knows the general outlines of industrial
history. Harrison’s <i>Elizabethan England</i> (now published in the
Camelot Classics Series) might be read in a similar way, as giving
a picture of sixteenth century life.</p>

<p>I must acknowledge my indebtedness to all the above works,
which I have freely used in this little history, and especially to the
works of Professor Thorold Rogers, without which no complete
industrial history could have been written. I have also utilized
in some places the material already existing in my own <i>Short
Account of the Growth of English Industry</i> in the <i>Co-operative
Annual</i> of 1890, and in my article on <i>English Agriculture</i> in the
<i>Westminster Review</i> of December 1888. I have preferred to state
in this note the more accessible works that I have consulted,
omitting others which are not immediately necessary for ordinary
readers, rather than to burden my pages with continual footnotes
and references. I trust that the works here indicated may help
to guide students of economic history in reading far beyond the
limits within which this short outline is necessarily confined.</p>

<p>I have also dealt with this subject more fully in a larger work
entitled <i>Industry in England</i> (Methuen: London, 1896).</p>

<p class="padtopc">Of recent years some standard works on Domesday have been
published, including Round’s <i>Feudal England</i>, F. W. Maitland’s
<i>Domesday Book and Beyond</i>, Vinogradoff’s <i>Villeinage in England</i>
and Ballard’s <i>Domesday Inquest</i>&mdash;the last being an excellent
summary. Webb’s <i>Industrial Democracy</i> and <i>History of Trade
Unionism</i>, Hobson’s <i>Evolution of Modern Capitalism</i> and Booth’s
monumental <i>Life and Labour of the People of London</i>, all deal with
the modern period. No serious student should fail to consult
the publications of Government departments and Royal Commissions
concerning questions of trade, industry, and social
progress. The census returns and the current Statistical
Abstracts are also useful. Bowley’s <i>Elementary Manual of
Statistics</i> affords valuable help in the interpretation of these
publications.</p>

<h3 id="p243" class="">NOTES</h3>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">1.</span> Population
of Roman Britain</h4> (p. <a href="#p002" title="go to p. 2">2</a>)&mdash;It is, of course, impossible
to state this accurately. Much of the land that supported
a large population in Roman times afterwards fell waste&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
the fens of the eastern counties (p. <a href="#p111" title="go to p. 111">111</a>); but the numerous
Roman remains still left to us testify to a considerable economic
development. (Cf. also the facts given in Cunningham’s <i>Growth
of English Industry</i>, p. 53).</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">2.</span>
Markets on Boundaries</h4> (p. <a href="#p003" title="go to p.
3">3</a>)&mdash;A good example of this is Moreton-in-Marsh, an ancient
market town situated on the boundaries of the four counties of Oxford,
Gloucester, Worcester and Warwick shires. This fact is recorded by a
stone, known as “the four shires’ stone,” and situated about a mile
from the town on the London Road. The religious origin of many markets,
alluded to in the case of Glasgow, should not be forgotten. (Cf.
Cunningham’s <i>Growth of English Industry</i>, p.
76.)</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">3.</span>
Danish Influence on Commerce</h4> (p. <a href="#p004" title="go to
p. 4">4</a>)&mdash;The Danes, before ever they came to England, were
enterprising navigators, as is shown by their very early commerce with
Russia, their colonization of Iceland (<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span>
874), and discovery of Greenland (<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 985),
and the coast of the (now) Eastern United States. They settled chiefly
in the north of England, in very large numbers and formed an active
industrial population, many of them becoming leading merchants. They
were instrumental in causing English trade to develop in the north of
Europe, and generally speaking gave a stimulus to navigation. (Cf.
Cunningham’s <i>Growth of English Industry</i>, p. 83 <i>sqq.</i>&mdash;1890
ed.)</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">4.</span>
Manorial Courts</h4> (p. <a href="#p019" title="go to p. 19">19</a>)&mdash;The court baron was composed of a
kind of jury of freeholders and was concerned with civil proceedings.
The court leet was composed of all tenants, both free and
serf, who acted as a jury in criminal cases, minor offences, and so
forth. Both courts were presided over by the lord of the manor
or his bailiff. Thus local discipline and law was concentrated in
the hands of the inhabitants of the parish
themselves, and the <span id="p244" class="xxpn">{244}</span>
manorial courts were a very useful means of education in local
self-government. Unfortunately their power, utility, and educational
influence declined with the decay of the whole manorial
system. (Cf. Rogers’ <i>Work and Wages</i>, pp. 63 and 420.&mdash;1889 ed.)</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">5.</span>
Decay of Manorial System</h4> (p. <a href="#p022" title="go to p. 22">22</a>)&mdash;The decay of this social
and economic system begins most clearly and markedly with the
changes made by the Black Death (1348), and by the social
revolution which followed it, of which the Peasants’ Revolt was
the first and most startling symptom (cf. pp. <a href="#p073" title="go to p. 73">73,</a> 74–77). The
legislation of Edward I. forms, again, another epoch from which
to date the decay of manorial institutions. As Dr Cunningham
says (<i>Growth of Industry</i>, p. 243), “In regard to commerce,
manufactures, and to agriculture alike, the local authorities
were gradually overtaken and superseded by the increasing
activity of Parliament, till in the time of Elizabeth the work was
practically finished.” The essentially local and personal relations
of the manor gave way to the more general and impersonal
relations of national government and national economy.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">6.</span>
The Jews</h4> (p. <a href="#p036" title="go to p. 36">36</a>)&mdash;It appears that this expulsion of the Jews
was not absolutely complete, and Jewish tradition gives the year
1358 as the date of final expulsion; but in 1410 a Jewish physician,
Elias Sabot, was certainly allowed to practise in England.
There seems to have been a certain immigration of Jews to England,
when they were expelled from Spain by Ferdinand and
Isabella (1492), for there are notices of them recovering debts in
English law-courts. Their presence in this country was, however,
only first <i>publicly</i> sanctioned by Cromwell; and during the
Commonwealth and the reign of Charles II. they came back here
in considerable numbers. (Cf. Wolf’s <i>Anglo-Jewish Exhibition
Papers</i>, p. 57; and my own <i>History of Commerce in Europe</i>, p. 99.)</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">7.</span>
Commercial relations with Flanders</h4> (p. <a href="#p049" title="go to p. 49">49</a>)&mdash;We may add to
the notices here given the treaty of 1274 between Edward I. and
the Countess of Flanders, protecting the export of English wool
to Flanders, and the well-known case of Perkin Warbeck. This
impostor was supported by the dowager Duchess of Burgundy,
and was well received in Flanders, then ruled by the Archduke
Philip. As Philip, at the instigation of the Duchess, encouraged
Warbeck, Henry VII. took the step of banishing all Flemings
from England (1493), and as Philip replied by expelling all the
English from Flanders, commercial intercourse between the two
countries was almost entirely suspended. The
result was, as <span id="p245" class="xxpn">{245}</span>
Bacon tells us, this interruption “began to pinch the merchants
of both nations very sore,” and they besought their respective
sovereigns “to open the intercourse again.” Philip withdrew
his support from Warbeck and the impostor was left without resources,
so that his subsequent appearance in England was a
complete failure. The want of English wool thus altered the
policy of the Flemish rulers, and before long the “great treaty,”
or <i>Intercursus Magnus</i>, was made between the two nations (1496),
by which trade was once more allowed to proceed unchecked, and
“the English merchants came again to their mansion at Antwerp
where they were received with procession and great joy.”</div>

<p>Henry VII. also made a commercial treaty with Denmark
(1490); and one with the Republic of Florence, securing to that
city a stipulated supply of English wool every year. (Cf. <i>Commerce
in Europe</i>, p. 98.)</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">8.</span>
Other Sources of Income</h4> (p. <a href="#p050" title="go to p. 50">50</a>)&mdash;Of course we must not
forget that the kings who fought against the French got money for
their wars by other means as well. Large amounts were extorted
from the Jews; enormous debts were contracted by Edward III.
with the great Florentine bankers the Bardi; and his repudiation
of them in 1345 caused the failure of that firm. Edward III.
also pawned his crown and jewels, which were in pledge at
Cologne, and could not redeem them, till the Hansa merchants in
England came to his rescue and lent him the necessary cash in
return for trading privileges in London. (Cf. <i>Commerce in
Europe</i>, §§ 44 and 62. The question of taxation, etc., may be
studied from larger political histories.)</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">9.</span>
Assize of Bread and Ale</h4> (p. <a href="#p061" title="go to p. 61">61</a>)&mdash;The best example of such
regulation is found, perhaps, in the Act 13, Rich. II., st. 1, c. 8
(1389–90), which ordains: “Forasmuch as a man cannot put
the price of corn and other victuals in certain, the justices of the
peace shall every year make proclamation “by their discretion,”
according to the dearth of victuals, how much every mason,
carpenter, tiler, and other craftsmen, workmen, and other
labourers by the day shall take by the day, with meat and drink
or without meat and drink, and that every man shall obey such
proclamations from time to time, as a thing done by statute.”
Finally, provision is made for the correct keeping of the <i>assize</i>,
or <i>assessment</i> from time to time, of the prices of bread and ale.
The earliest notice of an “assize” in England is found in the
Parliament Rolls for 1203, but the practice
is probably much <span id="p246" class="xxpn">{246}</span>
older; and the most ancient law upon the subject is the 51st
Hen. III. (<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1266), “Assisa Panis et Cerevisiæ.” The assize
of bread was in force till the beginning of the nineteenth century,
and was only then abolished in London.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">10.</span>
Stourbridge Fair</h4> (p. <a href="#p063" title="go to p. 63">63</a>)&mdash;This Stourbridge or Sturbridge is
now almost in Cambridge itself, the relics of the fair being held
in a field near Barnwell, about a mile and a half from the city.
In ancient times it was very easy for merchants to come up the
River Ouse in barges or light boats, as water-transport was much
more used then than now, and even the sea-going ships were very
light craft. Probably a Flemish merchant would find no difficulty
in sailing all the way from Antwerp to Cambridge in a light ship.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">11.</span>
Survivals of Villeinage</h4> (pp. <a href="#p074" title="go to p. 74">74,</a> 79)&mdash;Of course an ancient and
universal custom could not die out all at once, but its decay after
1381 was certainly rapid. Dr Cunningham (<i>Growth of Industry</i>,
p. 360) quotes cases to prove that villeinage existed in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but he himself says that Fitzherbert
(<i>On Surveyinge</i>, 1539) “laments over the continuance of
villanage as a disgrace to the country”; and Fitzherbert would
surely not have spoken thus if it was a recognized institution,
instead of a decaying survival. Again, in 1574 Elizabeth
enfranchised all bondmen on her estates; and she would hardly
have done this if it had been the universal custom to retain
villeins in their old bondage. We may readily admit that there
were plenty of survivals of villeinage, although the old institutions
were practically obsolete.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">11<i>a</i>.</span>
Monopolies</h4> (p. <a href="#p102" title="go to p. 102">102</a>)&mdash;These had been used by the crown
partly in order to raise money by their sale and partly as a
convenient method of paying or rewarding ministers or court
favourites. Thus Elizabeth’s favourite, Essex, had a monopoly
of sweet wines. But by Elizabeth’s time they had become so
unpopular, and people saw so clearly the taxes which they
inflicted on all articles thus monopolized that Parliament demanded
(in 1601) their abolition. So determined was the House
that the Queen gave way, though she was no doubt within the
legal limits of her prerogative. James I., however, used his prerogative
to create so many new monopolies that Parliament again
protested (in 1609), and he also revoked them all. But after the
suspension of Parliamentary government in 1614 monopolies
were granted again, till in 1621 their revocation was one of the
main points mentioned among the grievances
which the House <span id="p247" class="xxpn">{247}</span>
of Commons proceeded to redress, and monopolies were then once
more abolished. The three patents (or monopolies) chiefly complained
of were those on (1) inns and hostelries, (2) alehouses,
(3) gold and silver thread. The Act abolishing monopolies is the
21 Jac. I. cap. 3 (1624). This Parliamentary struggle about
monopolies shows very clearly the beginnings of the great fight
between Parliament and the Crown, the former trying to regain
rights which had for some time (especially under the Tudors)
been in abeyance, and the Crown to keep prerogatives which had
hitherto been exercised unchecked.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">12.</span>
Elizabeth’s Poor Law</h4> (p. <a href="#p107" title="go to p. 107">107</a>)&mdash;There is no doubt that the
original intention of the Act was beneficent, and its framers are
not to be held responsible for the use made of it in later times.</div>

<p>The <em class="em-bold">Act of Apprenticeship</em>, incidentally
fixing wages by assessment, was mainly concerned with the relations of
masters to their journeymen and apprentices; and enacted also that no
person should exercise a craft or trade unless he had been apprenticed
to it for seven years.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">13.</span>
Banking and the Stop of the Exchequer</h4> (p. <a href="#p130" title="go to p. 130">130</a>)&mdash;Banking
was now becoming a regular business, carried on especially by
goldsmiths, who often advanced money to the sovereign upon the
security of taxes or personal credit. A pamphlet of 1676, called
“The Mystery of the Newfashioned Goldsmiths or Bankers Discovered,”
shows how banking and money-lending had become
a regular business, and gives the year 1645 as about the time when
commercial men began regularly to put their cash in the hands of
goldsmiths. It also states that “the greatest of them (<i>i.e.</i> of the
goldsmiths) were enabled to supply Cromwell with money in
advance upon the revenues, as his occasions required, at great
advantage to themselves.” Similarly the famous goldsmith
George Heriot had frequently obliged James I. It is well known
how the London goldsmiths advanced Charles II. as much as
£1,300,000, at 8 to 10 per cent. interest, upon the security of the
taxes; and how (in 1672) he suddenly refused to pay them,
saying they must be content with the interest, and closed the
exchequer, thus causing a serious commercial panic.</div>

<p>The unsatisfactory method of obtaining loans from goldsmiths
and other private persons was partly the cause of William
Paterson’s project, now known as the <em class="em-bold">Bank of England</em> (1694).
Paterson offered to provide the Government of William III. with
£1,200,000, to be repaid by taxation on beer or
other liquors and <span id="p248" class="xxpn">{248}</span>
by rates on shipping, while those who subscribed this money were
incorporated into a regular company which was to receive 8 per
cent. interest and also £4000 a year for management. Thus the
matter of loans was first placed upon a proper basis and the Bank
thus formed, and supported by Government credit, took at once
a leading position in English commerce. (Cf. Rogers’ <i>First Nine
Years of Bank of England</i>.)</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">14.</span>
National Debt</h4> (p. <a href="#p145" title="go to p. 145">145</a>)&mdash;This loan, mentioned in the last
note, was the beginning of a regular National Debt, the system of
contracting loans upon the security of the supplies or upon
Government credit, and of paying them off gradually in succeeding
generations. (Cf. my <i>Commerce in Europe</i>, p. 145, and Grellier’s
<i>National Debt</i>.)</div>

<p><em class="em-bold">The Restoration of the Currency</em> was due to
Montague, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Up to the time of Charles
II. silver money was made by simply cutting the metal with shears, and
shaping and stamping it with a hammer. It was thus quite easy to clip
or shear the coins again without being detected, and then pass them off
to an unsuspecting person for their full nominal value. So the coins
became smaller and smaller, and people often found on presenting them
at a bank or elsewhere that they were only worth half their nominal
value. At first, under Charles II., it was thought sufficient to issue
new coins with a ribbed or “milled” edge, but the only result of
this was that the good coin was melted or exported and (as is always
the case) the inferior money remained at home. It was then seen, by
Montague and Sir Isaac Newton (the Master of the Mint), that the only
way was to <i>call in</i> the old coinage and issue an entirely new and
true milled currency. The expenses of this re-coinage, which cost some
two and a half millions, were defrayed by a tax on window-panes. (Cf.
Rogers’ <i>Economic Interpretation of History</i>, p. 200.)</p>

<p><em class="em-bold">The East India Company’s New Charter</em> was granted on October
7th, 1693, by William III., and restored all the former powers and
privileges of the Company. This Company’s monopoly of trade
with India had been frequently infringed by private traders, and
it was generally regarded with such great hostility that the House
of Commons in 1692 requested the King to dissolve the Company
upon the ground of mismanagement and conduct injurious to
national interests. However, the enemies of the Company
failed, and all its privileges were confirmed by the Charter of
1693. Its monopoly was nevertheless still
often disregarded, and <span id="p249" class="xxpn">{249}</span>
the validity of it denied by Parliament in spite of the King’s
favour. A New Company was even formed in 1698, but after
a few years the two rival Companies were amalgamated (1708).</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">15.</span>
Export of Bullion</h4> (p. <a href="#p169" title="go to p. 169">169</a>)&mdash;“In form the prohibition on the
export of gold and silver coin continued to 1816. People were
allowed to export gold in bars, foreign coin, and bullion the produce
of foreign coin; and an oath had to be taken that exported
bars were of this character. People were hired to swear that they
were so, and sworn-off gold, as it was called, was worth 1&#x2060;½<i>d.</i> an
ounce more than other gold was. Three-halfpence an ounce was
the bullion-dealer’s payment for perjury” (Rogers’ <i>Economic
Interpretation of History</i>, p. 187).</div>

<p>The necessities of their Eastern trade compelled the East India
Company to acquire large stores of bullion and export it to India,
in spite of any prohibition to the contrary; and their trade, with
its enormous profits, was thus a very clear example of the mistaken
character of the theory which taught that gold and silver
must not be exported for fear of impoverishing the country.
This fact, in the case of the East Indian trade, was seen by some
economists early in the eighteenth century, and was then clearly
stated by a writer in the paper called the <i>British Merchant</i> (i. 26),
who estimated the export of bullion to India and China at
£400,000 or £500,000 a year (in 1764 it was £369,831, and
£532,705 in 1790). The <i>British Merchant</i> was first published
in 1713.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">16.</span>
Important Commercial Events</h4> (p. <a href="#p125" title="go to p. 125">125</a>)&mdash;Among the important
commercial events of this period one ought certainly to
include the <i>Darien Scheme</i> and the <i>Union of England and Scotland</i>,
although these belong more fitly to a History of Commerce than
of Industry. The Darien scheme was a project originated by
William Paterson, the founder of the Bank of England, who proposed
to colonize the Isthmus of Darien and use it as “the key of
the Indies and door of the world” for commerce. English
capitalists, however, would not support his scheme and it was
denounced by the English Parliament. Nevertheless a company
was formed in Scotland, called “The Scottish African and Indian
Company,” a charter was given it by the Scotch Parliament in
1695, and a capital of £900,000 was ultimately raised, £400,000
coming from Scotland, then a very poor country, and the rest
from English and Dutch merchants. The hostility of the East
India Company, the Levant Company, and of
the Dutch in <span id="p250" class="xxpn">{250}</span>
general, however, never ceased, and it was owing to their influence
that, when the ill-fated colony at last set out for Darien in July
1698, the settlers were left quite unaided against the attacks of
the Spaniards, who claimed the monopoly of South American
trade. In fact, Spanish attacks and the climate, so utterly unsuited
for European colonists, sealed the fate of the expedition,
and few who went out ever returned. This failure had the most
serious effect in impoverishing the Scotch, who could then ill
afford the loss, but there is little doubt that it greatly helped to
bring about the subsequent Act of Union between England and
Scotland, in which William Paterson was largely concerned (1707).
The Union proved of considerable benefit to Scotland, as, by it,
trade between the two countries became free, English ports and
colonies were thrown open to the Scotch, and Scotland found a
large market for woollen and linen goods and cattle in England.</div>

<p>The date of the <i>Methuen Treaty</i> is 1703, and it was arranged by
John Methuen between England and Portugal. It was agreed
that British woollen goods should be admitted into Portugal and
her colonies, provided that at all times Portuguese wines were
admitted into England at two-thirds of the duty (whatever it
might be) levied on French wines. The result was a considerable
increase of trade with Portugal, but an even greater decrease of
trade with France, while the wine-drinking of our upper classes
took a very different direction, for port, which had hitherto been
almost unknown in England, became the typical drink of the
English gentleman, and more port was sent to the United Kingdom
than to all the rest of Europe together. It was not till the
time of the commercial treaty of 1860 with France, that the heavy
duties on light French wines were reduced, and with them the
duties on French manufactures. Till then, as Gladstone said in
his speech on the subject in 1862, “it was almost thought a matter
of duty to regard Frenchmen as traditional enemies,” not only in
politics but in commerce. This treaty was only one among the
many great services of Cobden to the commerce of his country.</p>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">17.</span>
Deposition of East India Company</h4> (p. <a href="#p217" title="go to p. 217">217</a>)&mdash;In June, 1858,
the East India Company ceased to exist, the territories of India
were transferred to the Crown of England, and the Queen was
proclaimed sovereign of India on November 1st, 1858. The
Company’s army became part of the Queen’s army, and Lord
Canning, who had been Governor-General, became the first
Viceroy. All the powers hitherto exercised by
the East India <span id="p251" class="xxpn">{251}</span>
Company, or by the Board of Control, were vested in the Secretary
of State for India, assisted by a Council of fifteen members
appointed by the Crown.</div>

<div class="dh4"><h4><span class="nowrap">18.</span>
Huskisson’s Reforms</h4> (p. <a href="#p213" title="go to p. 213">213</a>)&mdash;It was Huskisson who in
1823 passed a “Reciprocity of Duties Bill,” by which English
and foreign ships had equal advantages in England whenever
foreign nations allowed the same to English vessels in their ports.
He threw open the commerce of our colonies, under certain
restrictions, to other nations. He reduced the duties on silk and
wool in 1824, and in the same year the Acts fixing wages (cf.
p. <a href="#p107" title="go to p. 107">107</a>), and limiting the free travelling about of workmen (p. <a href="#p189" title="go to p. 189">189</a>)
were repealed. So also were all laws controlling combinations
of either masters or workmen; though combinations of workmen
to intimidate employers were made
illegal in 1825.</div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
